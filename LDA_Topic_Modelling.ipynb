              "'Dear Stockholders, 2021 was an exceptional year for ABM, highlighted by strong financial performance and significant progress on multiple strategic fronts. Throughout the year, our global team continued to execute at the highest level, successfully navigating through a dynamic environment with agility, resiliency, and dedication to serve our clients, while at the same time, adapting to ever-changing COVID-19 protocols and advancing our brand and competitive positioning in our served markets. During 2021 we generated revenue of $6.2 billion, up 4% from 2020. Income from continuing operations (and net income) was $126.3 million, representing a significant increase over the prior year, while adjusted income from continuing operations* increased 49% to $243.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA* margin expanded to a record 7.3%, up 130 basis points from 2020, and significantly higher than our pre-COVID-19 pandemic level. 2021 also marked 56th consecutive year in which weâ\\x80\\x99ve paid a dividend, continuing our long-standing history. We are proud of our financial performance which illustrates the resiliency of our business and the growing importance of the services we provide across a wide landscape of commercial facilities. Our strong results were largely driven by increased demand for our proprietary EnhancedCleanâ\\x84¢ services which we developed in 2020 specifically to address the evolving needs of our clients as they continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth was also bolstered by a higher volume of work orders in all our Industry Groups and by our acquisition of Able Services (â\\x80\\x9cAbleâ\\x80\\x9d). EBITDA and margin growth were the product of higher revenues and a more favorable service mix, leveraged by our ability to gain efficiencies through the strategic deployment of labor. Further, we produced full year organic revenue growth in all our Industry Groups, apart from Aviation, which has been the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. That being said, Aviation grew strongly in the second half of 2021 as commercial air traffic meaningfully rebounded. Business & Industry (â\\x80\\x9cB&Iâ\\x80\\x9d) benefitted from new contract wins, continued client demand for work orders and strong growth in our distribution center end-markets. While office occupancy trended higher in 2021, office occupancy levels remain low by historical standards. Education and Technology & Manufacturing (â\\x80\\x9cT&Mâ\\x80\\x9d) both grew solidly in 2021, with Education benefitting from a broad-based return to classroom learning, while T&M markets moved in-line with a generally improved industrial economy. Lastly, Technical Solutions posted mid-single digit revenue growth, reflecting our fast-growing e-mobility business and improved access to client sites. I am really excited about the prospects of our e-mobility business, which has a multi-year growth path in front of it driven by the ongoing transition to Electric Vehicles, which should be accelerated by the recent passage of the federal infrastructure bill which included $7.5 billion toward deploying EV charging stations nationwide. We are extremely well-positioned as one of the largest EV charging station installers in the nation. We also made great progress on the strategic front in 2021 with the $830 million acquisition of Able, a leading facilities services provider, which we completed in September. Able, with approximately $1.1 billion in annualized revenue in 2021, substantially expands our geographic footprint, broadens our capabilities, and increases our scale. Able derives roughly 60% of its revenue from engineering and technical services and 40% from janitorial services, strongly complementing our existing B&I business and helping us be a more comprehensive service provider with our combined clients. Beyond that, the acquisition will assist in helping us achieve our strategic growth objectives as we build upon our offerings to include integrated facilities services and multi-service bundles to our core clients. We also finalized our new 5-year strategic plan which was introduced at our Investor Day in December 2021. Our ELEVATE plan was developed from our vast leanings during the COVID19 pandemic as well as our unique view and understanding of market trends. ELEVATE is a multiyear comprehensive investment initiative intended to enhance our use of advanced data and analytics to capture incremental growth and profit opportunities arising from macro shifts in demographics, rapidly changing workplace dynamics and the heightened need for increased corporate sustainability. At its core, ELEVATE includes strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, team member development, workforce management and digital transformation. Able is a great example of a revenue growth initiative and a critical component of our overall Elevate strategy. In all, we believe these investments will accelerate our organic growth, strengthen profitability, and create a more rewarding experience for both clients and team members. I am looking forward to sharing the progress of our ELEVATE program with you over the coming quarters. I was also pleased with the progress reported in our most recent Corporate Sustainability Report. This report emphasizes our ongoing commitment to a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, as well as our obligation to minimize our impact on the environment and to do business in a responsible way. Our purpose â\\x80\\x93 to take care of the people, spaces and places that are important to you â\\x80\\x93 is more significant now than it has ever been and continues to drive many of the decisions we make across the organization. I encourage you to learn more about our efforts by reading our Corporate Sustainability Report on our website, abm.com. We are entering 2022 from a position of strength, supported by a healthy balance sheet, solid cash flow and favorable growth trends across our business. We continue to support our clients by providing high-value services and solutions that have enabled them to navigate unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years. And with the recent acquisition of Able and the ELEVATE initiative, we have positioned ABM for sustained success. In short, I am excited about the direction in which we are heading and for ABMâ\\x80\\x99s future. I want to thank our more than 100,000 team members for their amazing contributions in 2021. It was not an easy year by any stretch, but their unwavering commitment and dedication to our clients and our Company enabled us to not only weather the continuing storms of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to rise above these challenges to deliver truly exceptional performance for all our stakeholders. Thank you for your continued interest and strong support of ABM. \\n\\nScott Salmirs \\n\\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\\n'"

As individuals, as a company and as a global community, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve had to navigate significant challenges and recalibrate our lives in big and small ways to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. For Thermo Fisher, the year will also stand out as one of our finest moments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for the way we supported science and society when they needed us most. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud of how we responded to the pandemic and managed our company successfully through a challenging environment, while also accelerating the execution of our growth strategy to create an even brighter future for our company. As a result, we dramatically increased our growth and created tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. In so many ways, it was our best year yet. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m deeply grateful to our 80,000 colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 some of whom appear on the cover of this annual report \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for making it possible. Track record of outstanding performance Our 2020 financial results were truly extraordinary, continuing our long track record of outstanding performance. During the year, we grew revenue by 26 percent to $32.22 billion. We also generated exceptional earnings growth. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 74 percent to $15.96, and adjusted EPS* grew 58 percent to $19.55. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $6.8 billion in 2020. At the same time, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through $1.8 billion of stock buybacks and a growing dividend. Our success during the year enabled us to advance our proven growth strategy at a time when many companies had to pull back, and we further strengthened our industry position by: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Continuing to develop high-impact, innovative new products \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers Commitment to innovation The first pillar of our growth strategy is innovation, and during 2020 we invested $1.2 billion in R&D to deliver new technologies to help our customers achieve their goals. This included a number of highly innovative products to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, we extended our industryleading Orbitrap platform with two new-generation Thermo Scientific Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched two Thermo Scientific Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes and introduced our Thermo Scientific Tundra Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscope \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. Also, in our bioproduction business, we launched a versatile bioprocess container, new cell-culture media, and an oligo resin to support vaccine and therapy development. Our teams also pivoted to support the pandemic response and moved rapidly to develop our Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which received emergency use authorization in the U.S. in March 2020, followed by similar authorizations around the world. We then significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19 related products, launching the Thermo Fisher Scientific Amplitude Solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our Applied Biosystems TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. With these innovations, we have established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 diagnostic testing, supporting hundreds of millions of COVID-19 PCR tests across the world. Leveraging our scale The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. China is our largest market outside the U.S., and to continue to strengthen our presence there and support the rapidly growing local biotech industry, during the year we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. We also announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. In addition, we opened new commercial centers to support materials science customers in China and South Korea. Our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve created in the region position us well to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. Creating value for our customers Our third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition, and entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Because of these trusted relationships, built over many years, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharmaceutical and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 related vaccines and therapies. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong we are as a partner in addressing their needs. In 2020, we committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to be an even better partner and accelerate our growth. We added capacity and capabilities in bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences, as well as other businesses across the company. We also entered into a strategic partnership with CSL \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 a global biotech company \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093to expand our biologics drug substance manufacturing capacity to serve this rapidly growing market. Driven by our Mission Our role in addressing the global health crisis is one of the best examples of how we create value for our customers. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also the most profound example of how we fulfill our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. We were ready for this moment because we built Thermo Fisher to serve society. Thanks to our unique culture, our understanding of science and our close customer relationships, we saw the need and we moved into action with speed at scale. Throughout the pandemic, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve worked closely with the highest levels of governments and healthcare institutions around the world, as well as with the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to support efforts in research, diagnostic testing, development and production of vaccines and treatments, and personal protection. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll share a few examples: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 When the health crisis first emerged in China, we immediately established round-the-clock service to support the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospitals and clinical labs, with PCR instruments to detect the virus and our next-generation sequencing instruments to understand it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As researchers around the world raced to determine the virus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 structure, our Thermo Scientific Krios cryo-electron microscopes helped them identify the spike protein and its cellular receptor during infection \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dramatically accelerating the path to vaccines and treatments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 We also worked closely with our suppliers worldwide to secure and manage the distribution of personal protective equipment to keep healthcare and essential workers and our own colleagues safe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the critical need for reliable diagnostics, we quickly developed a PCR-based workflow that is now widely used across the globe as the gold standard in testing, given its high level of accuracy. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As an essential partner to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies quickly develop and manufacture vaccines and therapies, we supported more than 300 of the top projects around the world with our pharma services and other capabilities across our company. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the requirements of the vaccines, we ramped up production of ultra-low temperature freezers to support storage and distribution well in advance of the vaccine roll-out. All of this enabled the global response to the pandemic while also creating long-term opportunities for our company.\\n\\nNavigating a challenging environment To support our customers and help them overcome their obstacles during the year, we managed our company deftly through the many aspects of a challenging environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 rapidly changing market conditions, the ins and outs of government lockdowns, adjustments in the way we work, and the personal and professional challenges facing our team members. Three principles have guided our actions throughout this unprecedented time: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 First and foremost, keep our colleagues safe and inspired to fulfill our Mission \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Maintain business continuity to best serve our customers \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Manage the company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader Staying true to these principles has served us well, and our colleagues have told us how much they appreciate the way we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve managed the company during this time and how proud they are to be part of Thermo Fisher. As always, our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System was a major factor in our success. PPI is the discipline that shapes the way we work and creates a mindset within our company for finding a better way every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 helping us to solve problems, increase efficiency, work more effectively and continuously improve our company. During 2020, our execution through PPI enabled us to successfully navigate short-term challenges and scale our pandemic response at an unprecedented speed, which allowed us to capture new opportunities and exceed our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 expectations. Increasing our social impact We also realize that our obligation as an industry leader goes beyond providing products and services to enable our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 work. We have a responsibility to make the world a better place through involvement in our communities and through our business and hiring practices. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud that in 2020 we took steps to significantly increase our social impact. Education creates opportunities for all, so in August we launched The Just Project, honoring pioneering biologist Ernest Everett Just. This involved a donation of $25 million in diagnostic instruments, test kits and related supplies to enable free COVID-19 testing at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and support the safe return of students to these campuses. We also committed to hiring at least 500 graduates from HBCUs over the next three years. With the need for scientists and innovators front and center last year, we also invested $30 million to establish our Foundation for Science, which will amplify our longstanding commitment to STEM education, with a focus on underserved communities. In addition, we expanded our matching gift program to multiply our colleagues\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 charitable contributions, and we doubled funding for our Community Action Councils \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 colleague-led teams that do tremendous humanitarian work in our local communities. Living by our values Of course, our social impact begins right here inside Thermo Fisher with the kind of environment we create for our colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 who represent nearly every race, ethnicity, background, gender and orientation. While there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s always more we can do, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve come a long way in building an inclusive culture where our colleagues know their unique backgrounds and perspectives are valued, and they are inspired to bring their best every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 which drives continuous improvement for our company and new solutions for our customers. As we continue this journey, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m proud that our company has been named \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for the sixth consecutive year. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve also been named one of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTop 100 Most Attractive Employers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in China, a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGreat Place to Work\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in India and have received similar recognitions in Europe. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and living by our 4i Values \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Our corporate governance structure supports accountability and transparency, with a strong, diverse board of directors; annual director elections; a one-share, one-vote rule; bestpractice internal and external pay equity; and leading diversity disclosure practices. We also recognize that acting responsibly and sustainably includes an obligation to be a good steward of our planet. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve taken many steps over the years to reduce our environmental impact, both in our operations and in the products we make and deliver to our customers. We are working toward a goal to reduce our greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2030, and we continue to expand our portfolio of green products to help our customers meet their own goals for energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. All of this is the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Our culture and our leading social and environmental practices help us recruit top talent and strengthen our industry leadership, while helping to make the world a better place. CSR Hub puts Thermo Fisher in the 90th percentile for responsible ESG practices.i And, we were chosen in December 2020 as one of ESG fund managers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 favorite international companies.ii Thermo Fisher\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stakeholders include our customers, our colleagues, our shareholders \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and society overall. We believe that doing right by all of them drives our success, and our results speak for themselves. As I think about the future, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been more excited about the opportunities we have to make an even greater impact for science and society. Propelled by our Mission and the passion of our 80,000 colleagues, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll continue to create value and earn your trust every day. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMarc N. Casper \\n\\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\",\n          \"DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS:\\n\\nAs we consider the past year, three words consistently rise to the top: Determination, progress and resilience. We, and the entire Rite Aid Board of Directors, are immensely proud of the more than 50,000 associates that worked through pandemic-related challenges to keep their communities healthy and thriving. Our collective determination to help customers manage through the pandemic, while also transforming our organization, actually accelerated our work to be a demonstrably different company in just one year. Our associates have shown resilience in every aspect of our business, from pivoting daily on COVID-19 testing and vaccines to positioning new brands and merchandise, and keeping stores, distribution centers, mail order facilities and call centers open, all without missing a beat. This determination has been a differentiator for the organization. And so, in a year like no other, we have made significant progress in creating a whole new Rite Aid and setting the foundation for enhanced stockholder value. We are also pleased to report on our progress aligned with our purpose. We demonstrated that we can deliver on our core mission of keeping our communities healthy and thriving, and at the same time position ourselves for a successful future. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our teams are clear on what needs to be done in Fiscal Year 2022: win today and in the future by creating real health care value, improving consumer engagement, and transforming our work to improve financial performance.\\n\\nAs we move into the second year of implementing our strategic plan, we are focused on:\\n\\nAccelerating our RxEvolution plan: Our initiatives are focused on three primary areas: 1) Managing Elixir client costs via seamless member engagement and better health outcomes; 2) Unlocking the value of our pharmacists; and 3) Transforming our retail and digital experience. We begin Fiscal Year 2022 with a newly branded and integrated pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) poised to expand its large and growing addressable market, a new retail brand, enhanced store footprint and merchandise assortment, more than 6,400 pharmacists who are whole health advisors serving their communities, and an incredible and energized team. More than ever, we are able to deliver on growth opportunities in retail and pharmacy service segments. Defining Rite Aid as a health care company: The pandemic validates our conviction that pharmacists are indeed the last mile connectors between the health care system and consumers. Although many may think of Rite Aid as a retailer, we are at our core a health care company, serving more than a million customers every day through our more than 2,500 retail stores, our pharmacy services call center, our mail order and specialty pharmacies, and through clinical and analytical services powered by our subsidiary, Health Dialog. Our personal connection to our customers through our trusted pharmacists is an important part of the future of health care in America. We are committed to fundamentally changing our role in health care and becoming the industry leader in whole health. Becoming a more efficient operator: In Fiscal Year 2021, we extended all but $91 million of our calendar 2023 bond maturities to calendar 2025and 2026, and ended the year with $1.7 billion in liquidity, which gives us ample flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives. As we executed our strategic plan, we increased revenues in both the retail pharmacy and pharmacy services segment, and grew market share in both retail and pharmacy in a highly competitive environment. Additionally, the Company implemented LEAN initiatives both to reduce working capital tied to inventory and improve our retail pharmacists\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 productivity. We also reduced back office costs  through consolidating administrative functions in our retail and pharmacy services lines of business into amore efficient structure. Enhancing our ESG practices: We continue to make progress in our ESG efforts, including fleet fuel reduction, decreased energy usage, and our continued progress in eliminating chemicals of concern. In addition, we performed an enterprise climate risk assessment, responded to CDP\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s climate change questionnaire, and invested in our associates through numerous program enhancements to keep them engaged. We are proud of the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our Board of Directors (88% of whom are racially diverse or female) and our executive leadership team (50% of whom are racially diverse or female), and are expanding our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts in Fiscal Year 2022. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, where we plan to share with you the progress we are making toward our vision and strategy for the Company. Instructions for joining the meeting are contained in the section of the Proxy Statement titled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInformation About the Annual Meeting and Voting.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d We look forward to continuing our work with the outstanding Rite Aid team to support the needs of our customers and drive growth, improved performance, and stockholder value. Thank you for your investment in Rite Aid. \\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHEYWARD DONIGAN\\n\\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\\n\",\n          \"To our stockholders: \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruption to world energy markets tested the resilience of Chevron and our strategies like never before. As we look toward economic recovery, we are grateful for our people and our partners. They have risen to the challenge, keeping global supply chains moving, powering manufacturing and transportation systems to deliver equipment and supplies to frontline workers, and ensuring essential products are available to those in need. The opportunity to leverage our assets and global relationships to give aid to others has been an honor for all of us at Chevron.\\n\\nBuilding on Strengths \\n\\nEven before COVID-19, we were preparing to lead in a future marked by change. Our actions were proactive and disciplined \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 simplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating leadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with greater accountability. \\n\\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and generate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic world where disruption is routine. \\n\\nOur financial priorities have not changed:\\n\\nGrowing the Dividend \\n\\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours as we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we increased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual increase in per-share dividend payout.\\n\\nReinvesting To Grow\\u00c2\\u00a0Future\\u00c2\\u00a0Cash Flows \\n\\nImproving capital efficiency allows us to sustain our future at a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is expected to generate free cash flow and added $13 billion in enterprise value.\\n\\nMaintaining A Strong Balance Sheet \\n\\nFinancial strength \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 demonstrated by our industry-leading net debt ratio \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 gives us the flexibility to navigate uncertain market conditions and address emerging opportunities.\\n\\nReturning Excess Cash To Stockholders \\n\\nAfter meeting the first three priorities, we return excess cash to stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased shares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion to stockholders in 2020.\\n\\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and we stand by them in difficult times. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged portfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in reliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock Exchange \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone.\\n\\nOperating With Resilience \\n\\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while natural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress in energy markets was compounded by intense competition for market share among the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s key oil producers. These disruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and growing economic distress. \\n\\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to extreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash flow and long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses that are low cost, large scale and long-lived \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 from our royalty advantaged position in the Permian and growing natural gas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock advantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on the U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the business cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and stronger cash flow for decades. \\n\\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also reduced operating costs, reflecting our commitment to both capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we demonstrated our flexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the same time, we redoubled internal transformation efforts to become more agile, cost efficient and streamlined. \\n\\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy added complementary high-quality assets in Texas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Permian Basin, Colorado\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s DJ Basin and the Eastern Mediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included approximately 5.67\\u00c2\\u00a0million net exploration acres. We added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the Noble\\u00c2\\u00a0Energy\\u00c2\\u00a0acquisition. \\n\\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we advanced construction of the Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea 408\\u00c2\\u00a0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and 1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, Kazakhstan and South Korea.\\n\\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a network of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned service stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, owned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel distribution depots. And we made excellent progress on GS Caltex\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s olefins mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. \\n\\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products and investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent with our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower carbon future. During the year, Chevron announced first gas production at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) joint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with Brightmark and announced first production of renewable base oil through a joint venture with Novvi. \\n\\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered one of our safest years ever. This reflects our commitment to protecting people and the environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and our unwavering determination to keep getting better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvancing A Lower-Carbon Future \\n\\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that drive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements we are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. Our energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas:\\n\\nWe are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest reduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to customers and society.\\n\\nWe are increasing renewables and offsets in support of our business.\\n\\nAnd we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities and operations to advance technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen. \\n\\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains more sustainable \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 so industries and customers who use our products can work toward building a lower-carbon world.\\n\\nLooking Ahead \\n\\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; a historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented disruption in energy markets. \\n\\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \\n\\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, scientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually recede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other great challenges \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for all and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. On this foundation of hope, optimism and confidence, we can work together to achieve an even brighter future. \\n\\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, providing the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that billions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in enabling human progress around the world. And we are deeply grateful to all our employees, partners and stockholders who make this work possible. \\n\\nThank you for your support and the trust you place in us. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMichael K.

As individuals, as a company and as a global community, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve had to navigate significant challenges and recalibrate our lives in big and small ways to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. For Thermo Fisher, the year will also stand out as one of our finest moments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for the way we supported science and society when they needed us most. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud of how we responded to the pandemic and managed our company successfully through a challenging environment, while also accelerating the execution of our growth strategy to create an even brighter future for our company. As a result, we dramatically increased our growth and created tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. In so many ways, it was our best year yet. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m deeply grateful to our 80,000 colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 some of whom appear on the cover of this annual report \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for making it possible. Track record of outstanding performance Our 2020 financial results were truly extraordinary, continuing our long track record of outstanding performance. During the year, we grew revenue by 26 percent to $32.22 billion. We also generated exceptional earnings growth. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 74 percent to $15.96, and adjusted EPS* grew 58 percent to $19.55. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $6.8 billion in 2020. At the same time, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through $1.8 billion of stock buybacks and a growing dividend. Our success during the year enabled us to advance our proven growth strategy at a time when many companies had to pull back, and we further strengthened our industry position by: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Continuing to develop high-impact, innovative new products \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers Commitment to innovation The first pillar of our growth strategy is innovation, and during 2020 we invested $1.2 billion in R&D to deliver new technologies to help our customers achieve their goals. This included a number of highly innovative products to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, we extended our industryleading Orbitrap platform with two new-generation Thermo Scientific Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched two Thermo Scientific Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes and introduced our Thermo Scientific Tundra Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscope \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. Also, in our bioproduction business, we launched a versatile bioprocess container, new cell-culture media, and an oligo resin to support vaccine and therapy development. Our teams also pivoted to support the pandemic response and moved rapidly to develop our Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which received emergency use authorization in the U.S. in March 2020, followed by similar authorizations around the world. We then significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19 related products, launching the Thermo Fisher Scientific Amplitude Solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our Applied Biosystems TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. With these innovations, we have established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 diagnostic testing, supporting hundreds of millions of COVID-19 PCR tests across the world. Leveraging our scale The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. China is our largest market outside the U.S., and to continue to strengthen our presence there and support the rapidly growing local biotech industry, during the year we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. We also announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. In addition, we opened new commercial centers to support materials science customers in China and South Korea. Our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve created in the region position us well to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. Creating value for our customers Our third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition, and entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Because of these trusted relationships, built over many years, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharmaceutical and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 related vaccines and therapies. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong we are as a partner in addressing their needs. In 2020, we committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to be an even better partner and accelerate our growth. We added capacity and capabilities in bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences, as well as other businesses across the company. We also entered into a strategic partnership with CSL \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 a global biotech company \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093to expand our biologics drug substance manufacturing capacity to serve this rapidly growing market. Driven by our Mission Our role in addressing the global health crisis is one of the best examples of how we create value for our customers. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also the most profound example of how we fulfill our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. We were ready for this moment because we built Thermo Fisher to serve society. Thanks to our unique culture, our understanding of science and our close customer relationships, we saw the need and we moved into action with speed at scale. Throughout the pandemic, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve worked closely with the highest levels of governments and healthcare institutions around the world, as well as with the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to support efforts in research, diagnostic testing, development and production of vaccines and treatments, and personal protection. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll share a few examples: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 When the health crisis first emerged in China, we immediately established round-the-clock service to support the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospitals and clinical labs, with PCR instruments to detect the virus and our next-generation sequencing instruments to understand it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As researchers around the world raced to determine the virus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 structure, our Thermo Scientific Krios cryo-electron microscopes helped them identify the spike protein and its cellular receptor during infection \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dramatically accelerating the path to vaccines and treatments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 We also worked closely with our suppliers worldwide to secure and manage the distribution of personal protective equipment to keep healthcare and essential workers and our own colleagues safe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the critical need for reliable diagnostics, we quickly developed a PCR-based workflow that is now widely used across the globe as the gold standard in testing, given its high level of accuracy. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As an essential partner to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies quickly develop and manufacture vaccines and therapies, we supported more than 300 of the top projects around the world with our pharma services and other capabilities across our company. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the requirements of the vaccines, we ramped up production of ultra-low temperature freezers to support storage and distribution well in advance of the vaccine roll-out. All of this enabled the global response to the pandemic while also creating long-term opportunities for our company.\\n\\nNavigating a challenging environment To support our customers and help them overcome their obstacles during the year, we managed our company deftly through the many aspects of a challenging environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 rapidly changing market conditions, the ins and outs of government lockdowns, adjustments in the way we work, and the personal and professional challenges facing our team members. Three principles have guided our actions throughout this unprecedented time: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 First and foremost, keep our colleagues safe and inspired to fulfill our Mission \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Maintain business continuity to best serve our customers \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Manage the company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader Staying true to these principles has served us well, and our colleagues have told us how much they appreciate the way we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve managed the company during this time and how proud they are to be part of Thermo Fisher. As always, our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System was a major factor in our success. PPI is the discipline that shapes the way we work and creates a mindset within our company for finding a better way every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 helping us to solve problems, increase efficiency, work more effectively and continuously improve our company. During 2020, our execution through PPI enabled us to successfully navigate short-term challenges and scale our pandemic response at an unprecedented speed, which allowed us to capture new opportunities and exceed our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 expectations. Increasing our social impact We also realize that our obligation as an industry leader goes beyond providing products and services to enable our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 work. We have a responsibility to make the world a better place through involvement in our communities and through our business and hiring practices. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud that in 2020 we took steps to significantly increase our social impact. Education creates opportunities for all, so in August we launched The Just Project, honoring pioneering biologist Ernest Everett Just. This involved a donation of $25 million in diagnostic instruments, test kits and related supplies to enable free COVID-19 testing at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and support the safe return of students to these campuses. We also committed to hiring at least 500 graduates from HBCUs over the next three years. With the need for scientists and innovators front and center last year, we also invested $30 million to establish our Foundation for Science, which will amplify our longstanding commitment to STEM education, with a focus on underserved communities. In addition, we expanded our matching gift program to multiply our colleagues\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 charitable contributions, and we doubled funding for our Community Action Councils \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 colleague-led teams that do tremendous humanitarian work in our local communities. Living by our values Of course, our social impact begins right here inside Thermo Fisher with the kind of environment we create for our colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 who represent nearly every race, ethnicity, background, gender and orientation. While there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s always more we can do, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve come a long way in building an inclusive culture where our colleagues know their unique backgrounds and perspectives are valued, and they are inspired to bring their best every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 which drives continuous improvement for our company and new solutions for our customers. As we continue this journey, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m proud that our company has been named \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for the sixth consecutive year. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve also been named one of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTop 100 Most Attractive Employers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in China, a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGreat Place to Work\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in India and have received similar recognitions in Europe. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and living by our 4i Values \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Our corporate governance structure supports accountability and transparency, with a strong, diverse board of directors; annual director elections; a one-share, one-vote rule; bestpractice internal and external pay equity; and leading diversity disclosure practices. We also recognize that acting responsibly and sustainably includes an obligation to be a good steward of our planet. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve taken many steps over the years to reduce our environmental impact, both in our operations and in the products we make and deliver to our customers. We are working toward a goal to reduce our greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2030, and we continue to expand our portfolio of green products to help our customers meet their own goals for energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. All of this is the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Our culture and our leading social and environmental practices help us recruit top talent and strengthen our industry leadership, while helping to make the world a better place. CSR Hub puts Thermo Fisher in the 90th percentile for responsible ESG practices.i And, we were chosen in December 2020 as one of ESG fund managers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 favorite international companies.ii Thermo Fisher\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stakeholders include our customers, our colleagues, our shareholders \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and society overall. We believe that doing right by all of them drives our success, and our results speak for themselves. As I think about the future, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been more excited about the opportunities we have to make an even greater impact for science and society. Propelled by our Mission and the passion of our 80,000 colleagues, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll continue to create value and earn your trust every day. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMarc N. Casper \\n\\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\",\n          \"DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS:\\n\\nAs we consider the past year, three words consistently rise to the top: Determination, progress and resilience. We, and the entire Rite Aid Board of Directors, are immensely proud of the more than 50,000 associates that worked through pandemic-related challenges to keep their communities healthy and thriving. Our collective determination to help customers manage through the pandemic, while also transforming our organization, actually accelerated our work to be a demonstrably different company in just one year. Our associates have shown resilience in every aspect of our business, from pivoting daily on COVID-19 testing and vaccines to positioning new brands and merchandise, and keeping stores, distribution centers, mail order facilities and call centers open, all without missing a beat. This determination has been a differentiator for the organization. And so, in a year like no other, we have made significant progress in creating a whole new Rite Aid and setting the foundation for enhanced stockholder value. We are also pleased to report on our progress aligned with our purpose. We demonstrated that we can deliver on our core mission of keeping our communities healthy and thriving, and at the same time position ourselves for a successful future. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our teams are clear on what needs to be done in Fiscal Year 2022: win today and in the future by creating real health care value, improving consumer engagement, and transforming our work to improve financial performance.\\n\\nAs we move into the second year of implementing our strategic plan, we are focused on:\\n\\nAccelerating our RxEvolution plan: Our initiatives are focused on three primary areas: 1) Managing Elixir client costs via seamless member engagement and better health outcomes; 2) Unlocking the value of our pharmacists; and 3) Transforming our retail and digital experience. We begin Fiscal Year 2022 with a newly branded and integrated pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) poised to expand its large and growing addressable market, a new retail brand, enhanced store footprint and merchandise assortment, more than 6,400 pharmacists who are whole health advisors serving their communities, and an incredible and energized team. More than ever, we are able to deliver on growth opportunities in retail and pharmacy service segments. Defining Rite Aid as a health care company: The pandemic validates our conviction that pharmacists are indeed the last mile connectors between the health care system and consumers. Although many may think of Rite Aid as a retailer, we are at our core a health care company, serving more than a million customers every day through our more than 2,500 retail stores, our pharmacy services call center, our mail order and specialty pharmacies, and through clinical and analytical services powered by our subsidiary, Health Dialog. Our personal connection to our customers through our trusted pharmacists is an important part of the future of health care in America. We are committed to fundamentally changing our role in health care and becoming the industry leader in whole health. Becoming a more efficient operator: In Fiscal Year 2021, we extended all but $91 million of our calendar 2023 bond maturities to calendar 2025and 2026, and ended the year with $1.7 billion in liquidity, which gives us ample flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives. As we executed our strategic plan, we increased revenues in both the retail pharmacy and pharmacy services segment, and grew market share in both retail and pharmacy in a highly competitive environment. Additionally, the Company implemented LEAN initiatives both to reduce working capital tied to inventory and improve our retail pharmacists\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 productivity. We also reduced back office costs  through consolidating administrative functions in our retail and pharmacy services lines of business into amore efficient structure. Enhancing our ESG practices: We continue to make progress in our ESG efforts, including fleet fuel reduction, decreased energy usage, and our continued progress in eliminating chemicals of concern. In addition, we performed an enterprise climate risk assessment, responded to CDP\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s climate change questionnaire, and invested in our associates through numerous program enhancements to keep them engaged. We are proud of the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our Board of Directors (88% of whom are racially diverse or female) and our executive leadership team (50% of whom are racially diverse or female), and are expanding our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts in Fiscal Year 2022. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, where we plan to share with you the progress we are making toward our vision and strategy for the Company. Instructions for joining the meeting are contained in the section of the Proxy Statement titled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInformation About the Annual Meeting and Voting.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d We look forward to continuing our work with the outstanding Rite Aid team to support the needs of our customers and drive growth, improved performance, and stockholder value. Thank you for your investment in Rite Aid. \\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHEYWARD DONIGAN\\n\\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\\n\",\n          \"To our stockholders: \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruption to world energy markets tested the resilience of Chevron and our strategies like never before. As we look toward economic recovery, we are grateful for our people and our partners. They have risen to the challenge, keeping global supply chains moving, powering manufacturing and transportation systems to deliver equipment and supplies to frontline workers, and ensuring essential products are available to those in need. The opportunity to leverage our assets and global relationships to give aid to others has been an honor for all of us at Chevron.\\n\\nBuilding on Strengths \\n\\nEven before COVID-19, we were preparing to lead in a future marked by change. Our actions were proactive and disciplined \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 simplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating leadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with greater accountability. \\n\\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and generate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic world where disruption is routine. \\n\\nOur financial priorities have not changed:\\n\\nGrowing the Dividend \\n\\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours as we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we increased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual increase in per-share dividend payout.\\n\\nReinvesting To Grow\\u00c2\\u00a0Future\\u00c2\\u00a0Cash Flows \\n\\nImproving capital efficiency allows us to sustain our future at a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is expected to generate free cash flow and added $13 billion in enterprise value.\\n\\nMaintaining A Strong Balance Sheet \\n\\nFinancial strength \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 demonstrated by our industry-leading net debt ratio \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 gives us the flexibility to navigate uncertain market conditions and address emerging opportunities.\\n\\nReturning Excess Cash To Stockholders \\n\\nAfter meeting the first three priorities, we return excess cash to stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased shares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion to stockholders in 2020.\\n\\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and we stand by them in difficult times. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged portfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in reliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock Exchange \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone.\\n\\nOperating With Resilience \\n\\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while natural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress in energy markets was compounded by intense competition for market share among the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s key oil producers. These disruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and growing economic distress. \\n\\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to extreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash flow and long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses that are low cost, large scale and long-lived \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 from our royalty advantaged position in the Permian and growing natural gas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock advantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on the U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the business cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and stronger cash flow for decades. \\n\\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also reduced operating costs, reflecting our commitment to both capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we demonstrated our flexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the same time, we redoubled internal transformation efforts to become more agile, cost efficient and streamlined. \\n\\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy added complementary high-quality assets in Texas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Permian Basin, Colorado\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s DJ Basin and the Eastern Mediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included approximately 5.67\\u00c2\\u00a0million net exploration acres. We added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the Noble\\u00c2\\u00a0Energy\\u00c2\\u00a0acquisition. \\n\\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we advanced construction of the Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea 408\\u00c2\\u00a0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and 1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, Kazakhstan and South Korea.\\n\\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a network of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned service stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, owned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel distribution depots. And we made excellent progress on GS Caltex\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s olefins mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. \\n\\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products and investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent with our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower carbon future. During the year, Chevron announced first gas production at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) joint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with Brightmark and announced first production of renewable base oil through a joint venture with Novvi. \\n\\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered one of our safest years ever. This reflects our commitment to protecting people and the environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and our unwavering determination to keep getting better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvancing A Lower-Carbon Future \\n\\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that drive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements we are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. Our energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas:\\n\\nWe are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest reduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to customers and society.\\n\\nWe are increasing renewables and offsets in support of our business.\\n\\nAnd we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities and operations to advance technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen. \\n\\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains more sustainable \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 so industries and customers who use our products can work toward building a lower-carbon world.\\n\\nLooking Ahead \\n\\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; a historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented disruption in energy markets. \\n\\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \\n\\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, scientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually recede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other great challenges \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for all and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. On this foundation of hope, optimism and confidence, we can work together to achieve an even brighter future. \\n\\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, providing the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that billions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in enabling human progress around the world. And we are deeply grateful to all our employees, partners and stockholders who make this work possible. \\n\\nThank you for your support and the trust you place in us. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMichael K.

As individuals, as a company and as a global community, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve had to navigate significant challenges and recalibrate our lives in big and small ways to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. For Thermo Fisher, the year will also stand out as one of our finest moments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for the way we supported science and society when they needed us most. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud of how we responded to the pandemic and managed our company successfully through a challenging environment, while also accelerating the execution of our growth strategy to create an even brighter future for our company. As a result, we dramatically increased our growth and created tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. In so many ways, it was our best year yet. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m deeply grateful to our 80,000 colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 some of whom appear on the cover of this annual report \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for making it possible. Track record of outstanding performance Our 2020 financial results were truly extraordinary, continuing our long track record of outstanding performance. During the year, we grew revenue by 26 percent to $32.22 billion. We also generated exceptional earnings growth. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 74 percent to $15.96, and adjusted EPS* grew 58 percent to $19.55. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $6.8 billion in 2020. At the same time, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through $1.8 billion of stock buybacks and a growing dividend. Our success during the year enabled us to advance our proven growth strategy at a time when many companies had to pull back, and we further strengthened our industry position by: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Continuing to develop high-impact, innovative new products \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers Commitment to innovation The first pillar of our growth strategy is innovation, and during 2020 we invested $1.2 billion in R&D to deliver new technologies to help our customers achieve their goals. This included a number of highly innovative products to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, we extended our industryleading Orbitrap platform with two new-generation Thermo Scientific Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched two Thermo Scientific Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes and introduced our Thermo Scientific Tundra Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscope \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. Also, in our bioproduction business, we launched a versatile bioprocess container, new cell-culture media, and an oligo resin to support vaccine and therapy development. Our teams also pivoted to support the pandemic response and moved rapidly to develop our Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which received emergency use authorization in the U.S. in March 2020, followed by similar authorizations around the world. We then significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19 related products, launching the Thermo Fisher Scientific Amplitude Solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our Applied Biosystems TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. With these innovations, we have established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 diagnostic testing, supporting hundreds of millions of COVID-19 PCR tests across the world. Leveraging our scale The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. China is our largest market outside the U.S., and to continue to strengthen our presence there and support the rapidly growing local biotech industry, during the year we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. We also announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. In addition, we opened new commercial centers to support materials science customers in China and South Korea. Our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve created in the region position us well to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. Creating value for our customers Our third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition, and entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Because of these trusted relationships, built over many years, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharmaceutical and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 related vaccines and therapies. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong we are as a partner in addressing their needs. In 2020, we committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to be an even better partner and accelerate our growth. We added capacity and capabilities in bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences, as well as other businesses across the company. We also entered into a strategic partnership with CSL \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 a global biotech company \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093to expand our biologics drug substance manufacturing capacity to serve this rapidly growing market. Driven by our Mission Our role in addressing the global health crisis is one of the best examples of how we create value for our customers. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also the most profound example of how we fulfill our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. We were ready for this moment because we built Thermo Fisher to serve society. Thanks to our unique culture, our understanding of science and our close customer relationships, we saw the need and we moved into action with speed at scale. Throughout the pandemic, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve worked closely with the highest levels of governments and healthcare institutions around the world, as well as with the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to support efforts in research, diagnostic testing, development and production of vaccines and treatments, and personal protection. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll share a few examples: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 When the health crisis first emerged in China, we immediately established round-the-clock service to support the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospitals and clinical labs, with PCR instruments to detect the virus and our next-generation sequencing instruments to understand it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As researchers around the world raced to determine the virus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 structure, our Thermo Scientific Krios cryo-electron microscopes helped them identify the spike protein and its cellular receptor during infection \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dramatically accelerating the path to vaccines and treatments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 We also worked closely with our suppliers worldwide to secure and manage the distribution of personal protective equipment to keep healthcare and essential workers and our own colleagues safe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the critical need for reliable diagnostics, we quickly developed a PCR-based workflow that is now widely used across the globe as the gold standard in testing, given its high level of accuracy. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As an essential partner to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies quickly develop and manufacture vaccines and therapies, we supported more than 300 of the top projects around the world with our pharma services and other capabilities across our company. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the requirements of the vaccines, we ramped up production of ultra-low temperature freezers to support storage and distribution well in advance of the vaccine roll-out. All of this enabled the global response to the pandemic while also creating long-term opportunities for our company.\\n\\nNavigating a challenging environment To support our customers and help them overcome their obstacles during the year, we managed our company deftly through the many aspects of a challenging environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 rapidly changing market conditions, the ins and outs of government lockdowns, adjustments in the way we work, and the personal and professional challenges facing our team members. Three principles have guided our actions throughout this unprecedented time: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 First and foremost, keep our colleagues safe and inspired to fulfill our Mission \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Maintain business continuity to best serve our customers \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Manage the company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader Staying true to these principles has served us well, and our colleagues have told us how much they appreciate the way we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve managed the company during this time and how proud they are to be part of Thermo Fisher. As always, our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System was a major factor in our success. PPI is the discipline that shapes the way we work and creates a mindset within our company for finding a better way every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 helping us to solve problems, increase efficiency, work more effectively and continuously improve our company. During 2020, our execution through PPI enabled us to successfully navigate short-term challenges and scale our pandemic response at an unprecedented speed, which allowed us to capture new opportunities and exceed our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 expectations. Increasing our social impact We also realize that our obligation as an industry leader goes beyond providing products and services to enable our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 work. We have a responsibility to make the world a better place through involvement in our communities and through our business and hiring practices. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud that in 2020 we took steps to significantly increase our social impact. Education creates opportunities for all, so in August we launched The Just Project, honoring pioneering biologist Ernest Everett Just. This involved a donation of $25 million in diagnostic instruments, test kits and related supplies to enable free COVID-19 testing at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and support the safe return of students to these campuses. We also committed to hiring at least 500 graduates from HBCUs over the next three years. With the need for scientists and innovators front and center last year, we also invested $30 million to establish our Foundation for Science, which will amplify our longstanding commitment to STEM education, with a focus on underserved communities. In addition, we expanded our matching gift program to multiply our colleagues\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 charitable contributions, and we doubled funding for our Community Action Councils \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 colleague-led teams that do tremendous humanitarian work in our local communities. Living by our values Of course, our social impact begins right here inside Thermo Fisher with the kind of environment we create for our colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 who represent nearly every race, ethnicity, background, gender and orientation. While there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s always more we can do, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve come a long way in building an inclusive culture where our colleagues know their unique backgrounds and perspectives are valued, and they are inspired to bring their best every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 which drives continuous improvement for our company and new solutions for our customers. As we continue this journey, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m proud that our company has been named \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for the sixth consecutive year. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve also been named one of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTop 100 Most Attractive Employers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in China, a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGreat Place to Work\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in India and have received similar recognitions in Europe. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and living by our 4i Values \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Our corporate governance structure supports accountability and transparency, with a strong, diverse board of directors; annual director elections; a one-share, one-vote rule; bestpractice internal and external pay equity; and leading diversity disclosure practices. We also recognize that acting responsibly and sustainably includes an obligation to be a good steward of our planet. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve taken many steps over the years to reduce our environmental impact, both in our operations and in the products we make and deliver to our customers. We are working toward a goal to reduce our greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2030, and we continue to expand our portfolio of green products to help our customers meet their own goals for energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. All of this is the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Our culture and our leading social and environmental practices help us recruit top talent and strengthen our industry leadership, while helping to make the world a better place. CSR Hub puts Thermo Fisher in the 90th percentile for responsible ESG practices.i And, we were chosen in December 2020 as one of ESG fund managers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 favorite international companies.ii Thermo Fisher\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stakeholders include our customers, our colleagues, our shareholders \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and society overall. We believe that doing right by all of them drives our success, and our results speak for themselves. As I think about the future, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been more excited about the opportunities we have to make an even greater impact for science and society. Propelled by our Mission and the passion of our 80,000 colleagues, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll continue to create value and earn your trust every day. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMarc N. Casper \\n\\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\",\n          \"DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS:\\n\\nAs we consider the past year, three words consistently rise to the top: Determination, progress and resilience. We, and the entire Rite Aid Board of Directors, are immensely proud of the more than 50,000 associates that worked through pandemic-related challenges to keep their communities healthy and thriving. Our collective determination to help customers manage through the pandemic, while also transforming our organization, actually accelerated our work to be a demonstrably different company in just one year. Our associates have shown resilience in every aspect of our business, from pivoting daily on COVID-19 testing and vaccines to positioning new brands and merchandise, and keeping stores, distribution centers, mail order facilities and call centers open, all without missing a beat. This determination has been a differentiator for the organization. And so, in a year like no other, we have made significant progress in creating a whole new Rite Aid and setting the foundation for enhanced stockholder value. We are also pleased to report on our progress aligned with our purpose. We demonstrated that we can deliver on our core mission of keeping our communities healthy and thriving, and at the same time position ourselves for a successful future. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our teams are clear on what needs to be done in Fiscal Year 2022: win today and in the future by creating real health care value, improving consumer engagement, and transforming our work to improve financial performance.\\n\\nAs we move into the second year of implementing our strategic plan, we are focused on:\\n\\nAccelerating our RxEvolution plan: Our initiatives are focused on three primary areas: 1) Managing Elixir client costs via seamless member engagement and better health outcomes; 2) Unlocking the value of our pharmacists; and 3) Transforming our retail and digital experience. We begin Fiscal Year 2022 with a newly branded and integrated pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) poised to expand its large and growing addressable market, a new retail brand, enhanced store footprint and merchandise assortment, more than 6,400 pharmacists who are whole health advisors serving their communities, and an incredible and energized team. More than ever, we are able to deliver on growth opportunities in retail and pharmacy service segments. Defining Rite Aid as a health care company: The pandemic validates our conviction that pharmacists are indeed the last mile connectors between the health care system and consumers. Although many may think of Rite Aid as a retailer, we are at our core a health care company, serving more than a million customers every day through our more than 2,500 retail stores, our pharmacy services call center, our mail order and specialty pharmacies, and through clinical and analytical services powered by our subsidiary, Health Dialog. Our personal connection to our customers through our trusted pharmacists is an important part of the future of health care in America. We are committed to fundamentally changing our role in health care and becoming the industry leader in whole health. Becoming a more efficient operator: In Fiscal Year 2021, we extended all but $91 million of our calendar 2023 bond maturities to calendar 2025and 2026, and ended the year with $1.7 billion in liquidity, which gives us ample flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives. As we executed our strategic plan, we increased revenues in both the retail pharmacy and pharmacy services segment, and grew market share in both retail and pharmacy in a highly competitive environment. Additionally, the Company implemented LEAN initiatives both to reduce working capital tied to inventory and improve our retail pharmacists\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 productivity. We also reduced back office costs  through consolidating administrative functions in our retail and pharmacy services lines of business into amore efficient structure. Enhancing our ESG practices: We continue to make progress in our ESG efforts, including fleet fuel reduction, decreased energy usage, and our continued progress in eliminating chemicals of concern. In addition, we performed an enterprise climate risk assessment, responded to CDP\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s climate change questionnaire, and invested in our associates through numerous program enhancements to keep them engaged. We are proud of the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our Board of Directors (88% of whom are racially diverse or female) and our executive leadership team (50% of whom are racially diverse or female), and are expanding our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts in Fiscal Year 2022. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, where we plan to share with you the progress we are making toward our vision and strategy for the Company. Instructions for joining the meeting are contained in the section of the Proxy Statement titled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInformation About the Annual Meeting and Voting.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d We look forward to continuing our work with the outstanding Rite Aid team to support the needs of our customers and drive growth, improved performance, and stockholder value. Thank you for your investment in Rite Aid. \\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHEYWARD DONIGAN\\n\\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\\n\",\n          \"To our stockholders: \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruption to world energy markets tested the resilience of Chevron and our strategies like never before. As we look toward economic recovery, we are grateful for our people and our partners. They have risen to the challenge, keeping global supply chains moving, powering manufacturing and transportation systems to deliver equipment and supplies to frontline workers, and ensuring essential products are available to those in need. The opportunity to leverage our assets and global relationships to give aid to others has been an honor for all of us at Chevron.\\n\\nBuilding on Strengths \\n\\nEven before COVID-19, we were preparing to lead in a future marked by change. Our actions were proactive and disciplined \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 simplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating leadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with greater accountability. \\n\\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and generate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic world where disruption is routine. \\n\\nOur financial priorities have not changed:\\n\\nGrowing the Dividend \\n\\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours as we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we increased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual increase in per-share dividend payout.\\n\\nReinvesting To Grow\\u00c2\\u00a0Future\\u00c2\\u00a0Cash Flows \\n\\nImproving capital efficiency allows us to sustain our future at a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is expected to generate free cash flow and added $13 billion in enterprise value.\\n\\nMaintaining A Strong Balance Sheet \\n\\nFinancial strength \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 demonstrated by our industry-leading net debt ratio \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 gives us the flexibility to navigate uncertain market conditions and address emerging opportunities.\\n\\nReturning Excess Cash To Stockholders \\n\\nAfter meeting the first three priorities, we return excess cash to stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased shares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion to stockholders in 2020.\\n\\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and we stand by them in difficult times. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged portfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in reliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock Exchange \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone.\\n\\nOperating With Resilience \\n\\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while natural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress in energy markets was compounded by intense competition for market share among the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s key oil producers. These disruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and growing economic distress. \\n\\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to extreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash flow and long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses that are low cost, large scale and long-lived \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 from our royalty advantaged position in the Permian and growing natural gas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock advantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on the U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the business cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and stronger cash flow for decades. \\n\\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also reduced operating costs, reflecting our commitment to both capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we demonstrated our flexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the same time, we redoubled internal transformation efforts to become more agile, cost efficient and streamlined. \\n\\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy added complementary high-quality assets in Texas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Permian Basin, Colorado\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s DJ Basin and the Eastern Mediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included approximately 5.67\\u00c2\\u00a0million net exploration acres. We added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the Noble\\u00c2\\u00a0Energy\\u00c2\\u00a0acquisition. \\n\\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we advanced construction of the Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea 408\\u00c2\\u00a0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and 1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, Kazakhstan and South Korea.\\n\\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a network of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned service stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, owned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel distribution depots. And we made excellent progress on GS Caltex\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s olefins mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. \\n\\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products and investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent with our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower carbon future. During the year, Chevron announced first gas production at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) joint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with Brightmark and announced first production of renewable base oil through a joint venture with Novvi. \\n\\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered one of our safest years ever. This reflects our commitment to protecting people and the environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and our unwavering determination to keep getting better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvancing A Lower-Carbon Future \\n\\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that drive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements we are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. Our energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas:\\n\\nWe are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest reduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to customers and society.\\n\\nWe are increasing renewables and offsets in support of our business.\\n\\nAnd we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities and operations to advance technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen. \\n\\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains more sustainable \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 so industries and customers who use our products can work toward building a lower-carbon world.\\n\\nLooking Ahead \\n\\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; a historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented disruption in energy markets. \\n\\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \\n\\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, scientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually recede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other great challenges \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for all and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. On this foundation of hope, optimism and confidence, we can work together to achieve an even brighter future. \\n\\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, providing the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that billions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in enabling human progress around the world. And we are deeply grateful to all our employees, partners and stockholders who make this work possible. \\n\\nThank you for your support and the trust you place in us. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMichael K.

By the next morning, over a hundred 3Mers from across the Midwest had volunteered \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 at a moment\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s notice \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 to pack up, temporarily relocate and sacrifice time away from family to make a difference. It is inspiring, but it is not surprising. This is 3M. This is who we are and what we do. I have been with this company for more than three decades. 2020 was a year like no other, and I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been prouder of how 3Mers everywhere stepped up to help the world during a unique moment in history. Our response throughout COVID-19 has been guided by our purpose, and shaped by three priorities: protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Last year, we made more respirators than ever before, while continuing to innovate for customers, invest for the future and advance our values. As a result, 3M is well-positioned to lead through the global recovery and capitalize on market and technological trends that favor our market-leading businesses. That too is an example of who we are and what we do. Ultimately, we have more work to do to build an even stronger, more competitive enterprise. My commitment is for all of 3M to stay relentlessly focused on delivering extraordinary value for all stakeholders who have placed their trust in us \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 including premium returns for you, our shareholders.\\n\\nGood operational performance in an uncertain environment \\n\\nWith respect to 2020 financial results, the impact of COVID-19 and the global economic slowdowns varied across 3M. Some areas of our portfolio \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 such as personal safety \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 experienced higher demand, while others \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 such as health care elective procedures \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 faced substantial declines. Broadly speaking, we saw many of our end-markets sequentially improve as we moved through the second half of the year and as economies began to reopen, though of course significant economic uncertainty remains as we start 2021. Companywide, organic growth was -1.7%, along with earnings of $9.25 per share, or $8.74 on an adjusted basis. Our team delivered another year of robust free cash flow, up 23% to $6.6 billion, with a conversion rate of 123% \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 demonstrating our ability to perform across economic cycles. We posted a good return on invested capital of 18%, along with operating margins of 22%, and adjusted operating margins of nearly 21%. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and 2020 marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. \\n\\nProtecting lives in the global pandemic \\n\\nBeyond financial results, 2020 was a year in which 3M stepped up where we were needed the most. Our company has a unique and critical responsibility in pandemic preparedness and response, and it starts with an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our employees. When the virus broke out, we moved quickly to remote work where possible, while instituting more robust safety protocols in our factories and other facilities. For 3Mers personally affected, we implemented pandemic support policies to help protect their pay and benefits and allow them to take care of themselves and their families. At the same time, we worked to protect the public, including and especially the nurses, doctors and first responders on the front lines. 3M is a longtime leader in personal safety, with a range of science-based solutions for respiratory, face, hearing and fall protection. These include our N95 respirators, which 3M pioneered 50 years ago, and which we have continuously refined and improved ever since. The bulk of our N95 respirators are manufactured in the United States at plants in Nebraska and South Dakota; we also have manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Following SARS in the early 2000s, we decided to prepare for future crises by investing in significant respirator surge capacity at our plants. Those investments have enabled us to respond to emergencies such as H1N1, the Japanese tsunami and wildfires. When the world needs us, 3M is there.\\n\\nThus, when COVID-19 emerged in January, we were able to quickly activate our surge capacity and double our production of respirators to support the urgent public health response. We have since made additional investments, and forged partnerships with other companies and governments around the world, to continuously bring on additional capacity. In total, 3M produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally in 2020, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are producing respirators at a rate of 2.5 billion per year, a 4-fold increase versus 2019. Our team has also collaborated with law enforcement and retailers to combat price-gouging, counterfeiting and other fraudulent activity. We published our respirator prices, filed nearly two dozen lawsuits and removed thousands of deceptive websites and social media posts. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve helped identify more than 10 million counterfeit respirators, protecting healthcare workers from bad actors. In addition to respirators, 3M has led the fight against COVID-19 in other important ways. Our biopharma filtration solutions have helped speed development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We introduced new daily face coverings, and quickly adapted our cleaning and disinfecting product lines to serve new customers. We also made investments to support vulnerable populations, and helped young students learn remotely through science-at-home programs. At the center of our COVID-19 response has been our people: from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories and distribution centers, to the retirees who came back to staff our fraud hotline, to those who answered the call in Valley, Nebraska. People across 3M have stepped up to make a difference, and I cannot thank our entire team enough for their extraordinary contributions in 2020.\\n\\nInvesting for the future \\n\\nAs we fought COVID-19 on so many fronts, we never lost focus on taking strategic actions to position ourselves for long-term growth, productivity and value creation. Innovation differentiates 3M, and last year we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and capital expenditures, enabling us to both invent and manufacture unique solutions for customers. We found ways to innovate faster and differently, while driving strong results in our priority growth platforms like indoor air quality, biopharma filtration and automotive electrification. For example, last year we introduced cutting-edge products to improve electric car batteries, one element of our work to support more sustainable vehicle designs. For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7%, outperforming the markets they serve. 3M also continued to advance the new, streamlined global operating model that we implemented at the beginning of 2020, a significant step in our transformation. Our new model has enabled us to respond to the pandemic with agility and resilience \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 from expansion of respirator production to our ability to maintain business continuity, strong customer service and the integrity of our supply chain. To further optimize our model and streamline our organization, we initiated a series of actions across the company that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 to $300 million. Disciplined capital allocation across the entire company \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 coupled with strong cash flow \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 also helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. As a result, we exited 2020 with a stronger balance sheet and capital structure, and well-positioned for the future.\\n\\nPositioned for growth and emerging market trends \\n\\nCOVID-19 is rapidly changing the global economy and the way people live, work and communicate. Years\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 worth of changes are unfolding in a matter of months, creating opportunities to unleash 3M science and drive sustainable, long-term growth. With people at home more, for example, there is growing need for products to maintain and improve households, increasing demand for our indoor air quality and do-it-yourself solutions. The rapid movement to a digital-first world opens more opportunities for our innovations that improve the performance of data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. An increased focus in other areas, such as personal safety and health care, is also highly attractive for 3M. To capitalize on these market trends, we are increasing the prioritization of investments where demand is strong, while digitizing our operations and accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. \\n\\nCommitted to science, society, sustainability \\n\\nAs we move forward, we will continue to step up our leadership in science, society and sustainability. The pandemic has emphasized the importance of science in solving the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s toughest challenges. For 3M, science drives us forward. We leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across all of our businesses, which helps make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. We are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers into the future. 3M is also partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020 we took steps to advance our values, including our commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion. We launched an ambitious plan to strengthen economic opportunities and education for people of color, and we are holding ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on recent progress. In February 2021 we released our first annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report with details on our goals and metrics, further increasing transparency in this important area. Similarly, we are strengthening our commitment to sustainability, another core value for 3M. Over the last two decades we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions significantly, and 3M products help our customers avoid millions of tons of emissions every year, including innovations that make cars, homes and electronics more energy efficient. At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to make our operations more sustainable, including anticipated investments of $1 billion over the next 20 years to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, further reduce water usage, and improve water quality.\\n\\nAt 3M, achieving our environmental goals means we will bend the curve in a way that goes beyond what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s expected, and accelerates improvements our world needs. For example, we plan to aggressively cut our carbon emissions: 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and be fully carbon neutral by 2050. We also expect to achieve a 10% reduction in water use by the end of next year, and a 25% reduction overall by 2030 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 saving 2.5 billion gallons of water annually. Our investments to improve water quality will allow us to put in place advanced technology by 2023 at our sites that use the most water, and have that technology fully operationalized by 2024, as we quickly move to return water to the environment better than what we took into our plants. This is 3M. This is who we are and this is what we do. \\n\\nMost successful endeavors - whether an organization or a social movement - are fueled by one big idea. For 3M, it is applying science to improve lives, and we are finding new and better ways to do that every day. I am confident in the future for 3M, and in our ability to continue doing what we do best: use science to make the world a safer, healthier and better place. \\n\\nThank you for your continued confidence in 3M.\\n\\nMike Roman\\n\\n3M Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3M_Roman_2020.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It is inspiring, but it is not surprising. This is 3M. This is who we are and what we do. I have been with this company for more than three decades. 2020 was a year like no other, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never been prouder of how 3Mers everywhere stepped up to help the world during a unique moment in history. Our response throughout COVID-19 has been guided by our purpose, and shaped by three priorities: protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Last year, we made more respirators than ever before, while continuing to innovate for customers, invest for the future and advance our values. As a result, 3M is well-positioned to lead through the global recovery and capitalize on market and technological trends that favor our market-leading businesses. That too is an example of who we are and what we do. Ultimately, we have more work to do to build an even stronger, more competitive enterprise. My commitment is for all of 3M to stay relentlessly focused on delivering extraordinary value for all stakeholders who have placed their trust in us â\\x80\\x94 including premium returns for you, our shareholders.\\n\\nGood operational performance in an uncertain environment \\n\\nWith respect to 2020 financial results, the impact of COVID-19 and the global economic slowdowns varied across 3M. Some areas of our portfolio â\\x80\\x94 such as personal safety â\\x80\\x94 experienced higher demand, while others â\\x80\\x94 such as health care elective procedures â\\x80\\x94 faced substantial declines. Broadly speaking, we saw many of our end-markets sequentially improve as we moved through the second half of the year and as economies began to reopen, though of course significant economic uncertainty remains as we start 2021. Companywide, organic growth was -1.7%, along with earnings of $9.25 per share, or $8.74 on an adjusted basis. Our team delivered another year of robust free cash flow, up 23% to $6.6 billion, with a conversion rate of 123% â\\x80\\x94 demonstrating our ability to perform across economic cycles. We posted a good return on invested capital of 18%, along with operating margins of 22%, and adjusted operating margins of nearly 21%. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and 2020 marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. \\n\\nProtecting lives in the global pandemic \\n\\nBeyond financial results, 2020 was a year in which 3M stepped up where we were needed the most. Our company has a unique and critical responsibility in pandemic preparedness and response, and it starts with an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our employees. When the virus broke out, we moved quickly to remote work where possible, while instituting more robust safety protocols in our factories and other facilities. For 3Mers personally affected, we implemented pandemic support policies to help protect their pay and benefits and allow them to take care of themselves and their families. At the same time, we worked to protect the public, including and especially the nurses, doctors and first responders on the front lines. 3M is a longtime leader in personal safety, with a range of science-based solutions for respiratory, face, hearing and fall protection. These include our N95 respirators, which 3M pioneered 50 years ago, and which we have continuously refined and improved ever since. The bulk of our N95 respirators are manufactured in the United States at plants in Nebraska and South Dakota; we also have manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Following SARS in the early 2000s, we decided to prepare for future crises by investing in significant respirator surge capacity at our plants. Those investments have enabled us to respond to emergencies such as H1N1, the Japanese tsunami and wildfires. When the world needs us, 3M is there.\\n\\nThus, when COVID-19 emerged in January, we were able to quickly activate our surge capacity and double our production of respirators to support the urgent public health response. We have since made additional investments, and forged partnerships with other companies and governments around the world, to continuously bring on additional capacity. In total, 3M produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally in 2020, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are producing respirators at a rate of 2.5 billion per year, a 4-fold increase versus 2019. Our team has also collaborated with law enforcement and retailers to combat price-gouging, counterfeiting and other fraudulent activity. We published our respirator prices, filed nearly two dozen lawsuits and removed thousands of deceptive websites and social media posts. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve helped identify more than 10 million counterfeit respirators, protecting healthcare workers from bad actors. In addition to respirators, 3M has led the fight against COVID-19 in other important ways. Our biopharma filtration solutions have helped speed development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We introduced new daily face coverings, and quickly adapted our cleaning and disinfecting product lines to serve new customers. We also made investments to support vulnerable populations, and helped young students learn remotely through science-at-home programs. At the center of our COVID-19 response has been our people: from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories and distribution centers, to the retirees who came back to staff our fraud hotline, to those who answered the call in Valley, Nebraska. People across 3M have stepped up to make a difference, and I cannot thank our entire team enough for their extraordinary contributions in 2020.\\n\\nInvesting for the future \\n\\nAs we fought COVID-19 on so many fronts, we never lost focus on taking strategic actions to position ourselves for long-term growth, productivity and value creation. Innovation differentiates 3M, and last year we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and capital expenditures, enabling us to both invent and manufacture unique solutions for customers. We found ways to innovate faster and differently, while driving strong results in our priority growth platforms like indoor air quality, biopharma filtration and automotive electrification. For example, last year we introduced cutting-edge products to improve electric car batteries, one element of our work to support more sustainable vehicle designs. For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7%, outperforming the markets they serve. 3M also continued to advance the new, streamlined global operating model that we implemented at the beginning of 2020, a significant step in our transformation. Our new model has enabled us to respond to the pandemic with agility and resilience â\\x80\\x94 from expansion of respirator production to our ability to maintain business continuity, strong customer service and the integrity of our supply chain. To further optimize our model and streamline our organization, we initiated a series of actions across the company that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 to $300 million. Disciplined capital allocation across the entire company â\\x80\\x94 coupled with strong cash flow â\\x80\\x94 also helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. As a result, we exited 2020 with a stronger balance sheet and capital structure, and well-positioned for the future.\\n\\nPositioned for growth and emerging market trends \\n\\nCOVID-19 is rapidly changing the global economy and the way people live, work and communicate. Yearsâ\\x80\\x99 worth of changes are unfolding in a matter of months, creating opportunities to unleash 3M science and drive sustainable, long-term growth. With people at home more, for example, there is growing need for products to maintain and improve households, increasing demand for our indoor air quality and do-it-yourself solutions. The rapid movement to a digital-first world opens more opportunities for our innovations that improve the performance of data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. An increased focus in other areas, such as personal safety and health care, is also highly attractive for 3M. To capitalize on these market trends, we are increasing the prioritization of investments where demand is strong, while digitizing our operations and accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. \\n\\nCommitted to science, society, sustainability \\n\\nAs we move forward, we will continue to step up our leadership in science, society and sustainability. The pandemic has emphasized the importance of science in solving the worldâ\\x80\\x99s toughest challenges. For 3M, science drives us forward. We leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across all of our businesses, which helps make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. We are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers into the future. 3M is also partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020 we took steps to advance our values, including our commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion. We launched an ambitious plan to strengthen economic opportunities and education for people of color, and we are holding ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on recent progress. In February 2021 we released our first annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report with details on our goals and metrics, further increasing transparency in this important area. Similarly, we are strengthening our commitment to sustainability, another core value for 3M. Over the last two decades weâ\\x80\\x99ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions significantly, and 3M products help our customers avoid millions of tons of emissions every year, including innovations that make cars, homes and electronics more energy efficient. At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to make our operations more sustainable, including anticipated investments of $1 billion over the next 20 years to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, further reduce water usage, and improve water quality.\\n\\nAt 3M, achieving our environmental goals means we will bend the curve in a way that goes beyond whatâ\\x80\\x99s expected, and accelerates improvements our world needs. For example, we plan to aggressively cut our carbon emissions: 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and be fully carbon neutral by 2050. We also expect to achieve a 10% reduction in water use by the end of next year, and a 25% reduction overall by 2030 â\\x80\\x94 saving 2.5 billion gallons of water annually. Our investments to improve water quality will allow us to put in place advanced technology by 2023 at our sites that use the most water, and have that technology fully operationalized by 2024, as we quickly move to return water to the environment better than what we took into our plants. This is 3M. This is who we are and this is what we do. \\n\\nMost successful endeavors - whether an organization or a social movement - are fueled by one big idea. For 3M, it is applying science to improve lives, and we are finding new and better ways to do that every day. I am confident in the future for 3M, and in our ability to continue doing what we do best: use science to make the world a safer, healthier and better place. \\n\\nThank you for your continued confidence in 3M.\\n\\nMike Roman\\n\\n3M Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\\n'"

As individuals, as a company and as a global community, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve had to navigate significant challenges and recalibrate our lives in big and small ways to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. For Thermo Fisher, the year will also stand out as one of our finest moments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for the way we supported science and society when they needed us most. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud of how we responded to the pandemic and managed our company successfully through a challenging environment, while also accelerating the execution of our growth strategy to create an even brighter future for our company. As a result, we dramatically increased our growth and created tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. In so many ways, it was our best year yet. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m deeply grateful to our 80,000 colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 some of whom appear on the cover of this annual report \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 for making it possible. Track record of outstanding performance Our 2020 financial results were truly extraordinary, continuing our long track record of outstanding performance. During the year, we grew revenue by 26 percent to $32.22 billion. We also generated exceptional earnings growth. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 74 percent to $15.96, and adjusted EPS* grew 58 percent to $19.55. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $6.8 billion in 2020. At the same time, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through $1.8 billion of stock buybacks and a growing dividend. Our success during the year enabled us to advance our proven growth strategy at a time when many companies had to pull back, and we further strengthened our industry position by: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Continuing to develop high-impact, innovative new products \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers Commitment to innovation The first pillar of our growth strategy is innovation, and during 2020 we invested $1.2 billion in R&D to deliver new technologies to help our customers achieve their goals. This included a number of highly innovative products to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, we extended our industryleading Orbitrap platform with two new-generation Thermo Scientific Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched two Thermo Scientific Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes and introduced our Thermo Scientific Tundra Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscope \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. Also, in our bioproduction business, we launched a versatile bioprocess container, new cell-culture media, and an oligo resin to support vaccine and therapy development. Our teams also pivoted to support the pandemic response and moved rapidly to develop our Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which received emergency use authorization in the U.S. in March 2020, followed by similar authorizations around the world. We then significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19 related products, launching the Thermo Fisher Scientific Amplitude Solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our Applied Biosystems TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. With these innovations, we have established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 diagnostic testing, supporting hundreds of millions of COVID-19 PCR tests across the world. Leveraging our scale The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. China is our largest market outside the U.S., and to continue to strengthen our presence there and support the rapidly growing local biotech industry, during the year we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. We also announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. In addition, we opened new commercial centers to support materials science customers in China and South Korea. Our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve created in the region position us well to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. Creating value for our customers Our third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition, and entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Because of these trusted relationships, built over many years, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharmaceutical and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 related vaccines and therapies. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong we are as a partner in addressing their needs. In 2020, we committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to be an even better partner and accelerate our growth. We added capacity and capabilities in bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences, as well as other businesses across the company. We also entered into a strategic partnership with CSL \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 a global biotech company \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093to expand our biologics drug substance manufacturing capacity to serve this rapidly growing market. Driven by our Mission Our role in addressing the global health crisis is one of the best examples of how we create value for our customers. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also the most profound example of how we fulfill our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. We were ready for this moment because we built Thermo Fisher to serve society. Thanks to our unique culture, our understanding of science and our close customer relationships, we saw the need and we moved into action with speed at scale. Throughout the pandemic, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve worked closely with the highest levels of governments and healthcare institutions around the world, as well as with the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to support efforts in research, diagnostic testing, development and production of vaccines and treatments, and personal protection. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll share a few examples: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 When the health crisis first emerged in China, we immediately established round-the-clock service to support the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospitals and clinical labs, with PCR instruments to detect the virus and our next-generation sequencing instruments to understand it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As researchers around the world raced to determine the virus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 structure, our Thermo Scientific Krios cryo-electron microscopes helped them identify the spike protein and its cellular receptor during infection \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dramatically accelerating the path to vaccines and treatments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 We also worked closely with our suppliers worldwide to secure and manage the distribution of personal protective equipment to keep healthcare and essential workers and our own colleagues safe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the critical need for reliable diagnostics, we quickly developed a PCR-based workflow that is now widely used across the globe as the gold standard in testing, given its high level of accuracy. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 As an essential partner to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies quickly develop and manufacture vaccines and therapies, we supported more than 300 of the top projects around the world with our pharma services and other capabilities across our company. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Understanding the requirements of the vaccines, we ramped up production of ultra-low temperature freezers to support storage and distribution well in advance of the vaccine roll-out. All of this enabled the global response to the pandemic while also creating long-term opportunities for our company.\\n\\nNavigating a challenging environment To support our customers and help them overcome their obstacles during the year, we managed our company deftly through the many aspects of a challenging environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 rapidly changing market conditions, the ins and outs of government lockdowns, adjustments in the way we work, and the personal and professional challenges facing our team members. Three principles have guided our actions throughout this unprecedented time: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 First and foremost, keep our colleagues safe and inspired to fulfill our Mission \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Maintain business continuity to best serve our customers \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Manage the company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader Staying true to these principles has served us well, and our colleagues have told us how much they appreciate the way we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve managed the company during this time and how proud they are to be part of Thermo Fisher. As always, our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System was a major factor in our success. PPI is the discipline that shapes the way we work and creates a mindset within our company for finding a better way every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 helping us to solve problems, increase efficiency, work more effectively and continuously improve our company. During 2020, our execution through PPI enabled us to successfully navigate short-term challenges and scale our pandemic response at an unprecedented speed, which allowed us to capture new opportunities and exceed our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 expectations. Increasing our social impact We also realize that our obligation as an industry leader goes beyond providing products and services to enable our customers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 work. We have a responsibility to make the world a better place through involvement in our communities and through our business and hiring practices. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m very proud that in 2020 we took steps to significantly increase our social impact. Education creates opportunities for all, so in August we launched The Just Project, honoring pioneering biologist Ernest Everett Just. This involved a donation of $25 million in diagnostic instruments, test kits and related supplies to enable free COVID-19 testing at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and support the safe return of students to these campuses. We also committed to hiring at least 500 graduates from HBCUs over the next three years. With the need for scientists and innovators front and center last year, we also invested $30 million to establish our Foundation for Science, which will amplify our longstanding commitment to STEM education, with a focus on underserved communities. In addition, we expanded our matching gift program to multiply our colleagues\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 charitable contributions, and we doubled funding for our Community Action Councils \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 colleague-led teams that do tremendous humanitarian work in our local communities. Living by our values Of course, our social impact begins right here inside Thermo Fisher with the kind of environment we create for our colleagues \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 who represent nearly every race, ethnicity, background, gender and orientation. While there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s always more we can do, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve come a long way in building an inclusive culture where our colleagues know their unique backgrounds and perspectives are valued, and they are inspired to bring their best every day \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 which drives continuous improvement for our company and new solutions for our customers. As we continue this journey, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m proud that our company has been named \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for the sixth consecutive year. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve also been named one of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTop 100 Most Attractive Employers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in China, a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGreat Place to Work\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in India and have received similar recognitions in Europe. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and living by our 4i Values \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Our corporate governance structure supports accountability and transparency, with a strong, diverse board of directors; annual director elections; a one-share, one-vote rule; bestpractice internal and external pay equity; and leading diversity disclosure practices. We also recognize that acting responsibly and sustainably includes an obligation to be a good steward of our planet. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve taken many steps over the years to reduce our environmental impact, both in our operations and in the products we make and deliver to our customers. We are working toward a goal to reduce our greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2030, and we continue to expand our portfolio of green products to help our customers meet their own goals for energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. All of this is the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Our culture and our leading social and environmental practices help us recruit top talent and strengthen our industry leadership, while helping to make the world a better place. CSR Hub puts Thermo Fisher in the 90th percentile for responsible ESG practices.i And, we were chosen in December 2020 as one of ESG fund managers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 favorite international companies.ii Thermo Fisher\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stakeholders include our customers, our colleagues, our shareholders \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and society overall. We believe that doing right by all of them drives our success, and our results speak for themselves. As I think about the future, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been more excited about the opportunities we have to make an even greater impact for science and society. Propelled by our Mission and the passion of our 80,000 colleagues, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll continue to create value and earn your trust every day. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMarc N. Casper \\n\\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\",\n          \"DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS:\\n\\nAs we consider the past year, three words consistently rise to the top: Determination, progress and resilience. We, and the entire Rite Aid Board of Directors, are immensely proud of the more than 50,000 associates that worked through pandemic-related challenges to keep their communities healthy and thriving. Our collective determination to help customers manage through the pandemic, while also transforming our organization, actually accelerated our work to be a demonstrably different company in just one year. Our associates have shown resilience in every aspect of our business, from pivoting daily on COVID-19 testing and vaccines to positioning new brands and merchandise, and keeping stores, distribution centers, mail order facilities and call centers open, all without missing a beat. This determination has been a differentiator for the organization. And so, in a year like no other, we have made significant progress in creating a whole new Rite Aid and setting the foundation for enhanced stockholder value. We are also pleased to report on our progress aligned with our purpose. We demonstrated that we can deliver on our core mission of keeping our communities healthy and thriving, and at the same time position ourselves for a successful future. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our teams are clear on what needs to be done in Fiscal Year 2022: win today and in the future by creating real health care value, improving consumer engagement, and transforming our work to improve financial performance.\\n\\nAs we move into the second year of implementing our strategic plan, we are focused on:\\n\\nAccelerating our RxEvolution plan: Our initiatives are focused on three primary areas: 1) Managing Elixir client costs via seamless member engagement and better health outcomes; 2) Unlocking the value of our pharmacists; and 3) Transforming our retail and digital experience. We begin Fiscal Year 2022 with a newly branded and integrated pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) poised to expand its large and growing addressable market, a new retail brand, enhanced store footprint and merchandise assortment, more than 6,400 pharmacists who are whole health advisors serving their communities, and an incredible and energized team. More than ever, we are able to deliver on growth opportunities in retail and pharmacy service segments. Defining Rite Aid as a health care company: The pandemic validates our conviction that pharmacists are indeed the last mile connectors between the health care system and consumers. Although many may think of Rite Aid as a retailer, we are at our core a health care company, serving more than a million customers every day through our more than 2,500 retail stores, our pharmacy services call center, our mail order and specialty pharmacies, and through clinical and analytical services powered by our subsidiary, Health Dialog. Our personal connection to our customers through our trusted pharmacists is an important part of the future of health care in America. We are committed to fundamentally changing our role in health care and becoming the industry leader in whole health. Becoming a more efficient operator: In Fiscal Year 2021, we extended all but $91 million of our calendar 2023 bond maturities to calendar 2025and 2026, and ended the year with $1.7 billion in liquidity, which gives us ample flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives. As we executed our strategic plan, we increased revenues in both the retail pharmacy and pharmacy services segment, and grew market share in both retail and pharmacy in a highly competitive environment. Additionally, the Company implemented LEAN initiatives both to reduce working capital tied to inventory and improve our retail pharmacists\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 productivity. We also reduced back office costs  through consolidating administrative functions in our retail and pharmacy services lines of business into amore efficient structure. Enhancing our ESG practices: We continue to make progress in our ESG efforts, including fleet fuel reduction, decreased energy usage, and our continued progress in eliminating chemicals of concern. In addition, we performed an enterprise climate risk assessment, responded to CDP\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s climate change questionnaire, and invested in our associates through numerous program enhancements to keep them engaged. We are proud of the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our Board of Directors (88% of whom are racially diverse or female) and our executive leadership team (50% of whom are racially diverse or female), and are expanding our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts in Fiscal Year 2022. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, where we plan to share with you the progress we are making toward our vision and strategy for the Company. Instructions for joining the meeting are contained in the section of the Proxy Statement titled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInformation About the Annual Meeting and Voting.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d We look forward to continuing our work with the outstanding Rite Aid team to support the needs of our customers and drive growth, improved performance, and stockholder value. Thank you for your investment in Rite Aid. \\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHEYWARD DONIGAN\\n\\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\\n\",\n          \"To our stockholders: \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruption to world energy markets tested the resilience of Chevron and our strategies like never before. As we look toward economic recovery, we are grateful for our people and our partners. They have risen to the challenge, keeping global supply chains moving, powering manufacturing and transportation systems to deliver equipment and supplies to frontline workers, and ensuring essential products are available to those in need. The opportunity to leverage our assets and global relationships to give aid to others has been an honor for all of us at Chevron.\\n\\nBuilding on Strengths \\n\\nEven before COVID-19, we were preparing to lead in a future marked by change. Our actions were proactive and disciplined \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 simplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating leadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with greater accountability. \\n\\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and generate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic world where disruption is routine. \\n\\nOur financial priorities have not changed:\\n\\nGrowing the Dividend \\n\\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours as we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we increased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual increase in per-share dividend payout.\\n\\nReinvesting To Grow\\u00c2\\u00a0Future\\u00c2\\u00a0Cash Flows \\n\\nImproving capital efficiency allows us to sustain our future at a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is expected to generate free cash flow and added $13 billion in enterprise value.\\n\\nMaintaining A Strong Balance Sheet \\n\\nFinancial strength \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 demonstrated by our industry-leading net debt ratio \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 gives us the flexibility to navigate uncertain market conditions and address emerging opportunities.\\n\\nReturning Excess Cash To Stockholders \\n\\nAfter meeting the first three priorities, we return excess cash to stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased shares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion to stockholders in 2020.\\n\\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and we stand by them in difficult times. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged portfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in reliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock Exchange \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone.\\n\\nOperating With Resilience \\n\\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while natural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress in energy markets was compounded by intense competition for market share among the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s key oil producers. These disruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and growing economic distress. \\n\\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to extreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash flow and long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses that are low cost, large scale and long-lived \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 from our royalty advantaged position in the Permian and growing natural gas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock advantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on the U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the business cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and stronger cash flow for decades. \\n\\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also reduced operating costs, reflecting our commitment to both capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we demonstrated our flexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the same time, we redoubled internal transformation efforts to become more agile, cost efficient and streamlined. \\n\\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy added complementary high-quality assets in Texas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Permian Basin, Colorado\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s DJ Basin and the Eastern Mediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included approximately 5.67\\u00c2\\u00a0million net exploration acres. We added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the Noble\\u00c2\\u00a0Energy\\u00c2\\u00a0acquisition. \\n\\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we advanced construction of the Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea 408\\u00c2\\u00a0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and 1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, Kazakhstan and South Korea.\\n\\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a network of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned service stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, owned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel distribution depots. And we made excellent progress on GS Caltex\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s olefins mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. \\n\\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products and investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent with our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower carbon future. During the year, Chevron announced first gas production at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) joint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with Brightmark and announced first production of renewable base oil through a joint venture with Novvi. \\n\\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered one of our safest years ever. This reflects our commitment to protecting people and the environment \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and our unwavering determination to keep getting better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvancing A Lower-Carbon Future \\n\\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that drive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements we are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. Our energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas:\\n\\nWe are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest reduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to customers and society.\\n\\nWe are increasing renewables and offsets in support of our business.\\n\\nAnd we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities and operations to advance technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen. \\n\\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains more sustainable \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 so industries and customers who use our products can work toward building a lower-carbon world.\\n\\nLooking Ahead \\n\\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; a historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented disruption in energy markets. \\n\\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \\n\\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, scientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually recede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other great challenges \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for all and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. On this foundation of hope, optimism and confidence, we can work together to achieve an even brighter future. \\n\\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, providing the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that billions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in enabling human progress around the world. And we are deeply grateful to all our employees, partners and stockholders who make this work possible. \\n\\nThank you for your support and the trust you place in us. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMichael K.

And yet, as I reflect on what has been a very challenging year for so many\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094one that will be forever remembered as a heartbreaking chapter in our history\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I find reasons to be hopeful.\\n\\nOur mission\\u00c2\\u00a0to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more\\u00c2\\u00a0has never been more urgent or more needed. And every day this past year, I have had the privilege to see it in action, as customers of every size, in every industry, in every part of the world use our platforms and tools to help address their own challenges and opportunities as well as those of their communities and society at-large.\\n\\nI have had the honor to see how the hard work and commitment of Microsoft\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s employees, the ingenuity of our partners, the trust of our customers, and the support of our shareholders translate into strong results. In fiscal year 2021, we delivered $168 billion in revenue, up 18 percent year-over-year. Operating income grew 32 percent to $70 billion. And we continue to create successful new franchises. LinkedIn and our security business both passed $10 billion in annual revenue for the first time.\\n\\nOUR OPPORTUNITY\\n\\nFor all the disruption and suffering that the pandemic has wrought on our lives and our communities, it has also been the catalyst for an unprecedented digital transformation that is driving massive technological and societal shifts that are creating important new opportunities for our customers and for Microsoft.\\n\\nTech as a percentage of total GDP will double from 5 to 10 percent by 2030. But the most notable thing is what will happen to the other 90 percent. Digital transformation that was projected to happen over the next 10 years is happening today.\\n\\nMicrosoft was built for this moment. Our goal is to foster innovation that generates new ecosystems of inventors, partners, developers, creators, changemakers, public servants, frontline workers, and knowledge workers who, together, drive the engines of growth and opportunity in ways that benefit everyone.\\n\\nToday, it is exciting to see how our platforms and tools are enabling people and organizations to achieve remarkable things that would have been unimaginable even a few years ago.\\n\\nHere are just a few examples:\\n\\nNASA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Mars mission achieved a milestone in space exploration when the small robotic helicopter Ingenuity completed the first powered flight on another planet\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a feat that would not have been possible without 12,000 developers on GitHub who\\u00c2\\u00a0contributed code\\u00c2\\u00a0to the open source software that powered the flight.\\n\\nWhen a 1,300-foot ship blocked the Suez Canal and disrupted global shipping, our partner Blue Yonder\\u00c2\\u00a0used Microsoft AI technologies\\u00c2\\u00a0to help its customers find alternate sources for more than $500 million worth of products and parts affected by the delay.\\n\\nTeam Rubicon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a nonprofit organization that responds to humanitarian crises around the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094set up 169 COVID-19 response sites\\u00c2\\u00a0across the United States in just 30 days, using Dynamics 365 to manage the deployment of thousands of volunteers.\\n\\nSurgeons at Mt. Sinai Health System in New York and Kyabirwa Surgical Centre in Uganda have together\\u00c2\\u00a0performed more than 500 surgeries\\u00c2\\u00a0using mixed reality technology that enables doctors in New York to provide annotated recommendations that appear in the field of vision of their Ugandan colleagues\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094even though they are thousands of miles apart.\\n\\nAnheuser-Busch InBev\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s largest brewer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094used Azure Digital Twins\\u00c2\\u00a0to create a comprehensive digital model\\u00c2\\u00a0of its breweries and supply chain. Synchronized with its physical environment, this model replicates the complex relationships between natural ingredients and the brewing process, enabling brewmasters to make adjustments based on real-time conditions.\\n\\nAcross our solution areas, we are delivering platforms and tools that expand our opportunity to help organizations around the world build their own tech intensity.\\n\\nApplications and Infrastructure\\n\\nComputing architecture is undergoing radical transformation as the number of connected devices and the volume of data generated at the edge increase dramatically. With more than 60 datacenter regions\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including 15 new regions added this year on five continents\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094we are delivering faster access to data and cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements.\\n\\nThis year, we expanded our hybrid capabilities to enable organizations to build, manage, and deploy applications anywhere. With Azure Arc, customers can deploy Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, or in multicloud environments. Azure Space is extending Azure capabilities through worldwide satellite-based connectivity. And with Azure for Operators, we provide telecom operators and enterprises with the ultra-low latency cloud computing power at the edge needed for breakthrough scenarios like precision inventory tracking at ports and production lines that automatically adjust to changing demand.\\n\\nWe are also at the forefront of the enterprise metaverse, a new infrastructure layer made possible through the convergence of the digital and physical worlds. By combining the Internet of Things, AI, and mixed reality, this platform layer enables the creation of rich digital twin simulations of real-world processes, places, and things so organizations can monitor complex systems in real time, interact within them using mixed reality, and run simulations to model, analyze, and predict performance.\\n\\nData and AI\\n\\nNo asset is more strategic than data. In the next three years, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll create more data than we did in the past 10. But our ability to make sense of data is growing more difficult as the volume, velocity, and variety expand. The leading indicator of digital transformation success can be measured by an organization\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s ability to build predictive and analytical power.\\n\\nWe offer organizations the ability to ensure their data is being used only for their benefit. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, data warehousing, and big data analytics so organizations can query data on their own terms at any scale. And, new Azure Purview offers organizations comprehensive data management and governance to map all their data, whether it resides on-premises, in the cloud, or in software as a service (SaaS) applications.\\n\\nAnd we continue to bring rich AI capabilities directly into the data stack as large-scale models become powerful platforms in their own right. During the past year, our partner OpenAI achieved dramatic advances training models like GPT-3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the largest and most advanced language model in the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094on our Azure AI supercomputer. We exclusively licensed GPT-3, allowing us to leverage its technical innovations to deliver advanced AI solutions for our customers, as well as create new solutions that harness the power of advanced natural language generation.\\n\\nDeveloper Tools\\n\\nAs organizations focus on creating their own technology solutions, they will need standardized tools to modernize existing apps and build new ones.\\n\\nTo address this, we provide a complete chain of software development tools across every cloud and client platform. From Visual Studio to GitHub, we deliver the best tools for moving quickly from idea to code and from code to the cloud. Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly users, and GitHub is home to over 65 million developers who use it to build, ship, and maintain their software.\\n\\nAt the platform as a service (PaaS) level, new\\u00c2\\u00a0Azure Communication Services\\u00c2\\u00a0enable developers to integrate rich communications APIs into their applications using the same infrastructure that powers Microsoft Teams.\\n\\nWith Azure Mixed Reality Services, digital information can be represented within the context of the three-dimensional world we live in. And\\u00c2\\u00a0Microsoft Mesh\\u00c2\\u00a0enables developers to build immersive, multiuser, cross-platform mixed reality apps. It transforms how people connect holographically with others in a natural way.\\n\\nAnd, finally, our comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, frameworks, and infrastructure enables developers to build solutions that comprehend speech, make predictions, provide insights, and support decision-making.\\n\\nPower Platform\\n\\nApplication development is moving beyond professional developers and into the hands of citizen developers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094everyone from domain experts, to designers, marketers, salespeople, customer service professionals, teachers, students, and others.\\n\\nIn the same way that Office revolutionized productivity for knowledge workers, Power Platform\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094which has over 16 million monthly users\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094is transforming application development so that anyone can automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data.\\n\\nBusiness Applications\\n\\nEvery organization is looking to digitize their end-to-end operations\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094from sales and customer service to supply chain management\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094so they can rapidly adapt to changing market dynamics.\\n\\nWith Dynamics 365, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re building a new generation of business applications to meet this challenge.\\u00c2\\u00a0New integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams\\u00c2\\u00a0enable everyone across an organization to view and collaborate on customer records seamlessly within Teams, and to meet, chat, and collaborate within Dynamics 365.\\n\\nMore broadly, we are leading the way with solutions tailored to the needs of key industries. During the past year,\\u00c2\\u00a0we introduced industry clouds\\u00c2\\u00a0for financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, nonprofits, and retail that make it easier for organizations to take advantage of the full power of our tech stack and to utilize new, industry-specific customizations that improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs.\\n\\nAI is technology\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. And with our\\u00c2\\u00a0pending acquisition of Nuance Communications, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll provide ambient clinical intelligence capabilities for healthcare organizations that improve the patient experience and reduce the overwhelming burden of work that physicians struggle with today.\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nIn our rapidly changing digital economy, people need a platform where they can acquire new skills, expand their networks, and connect with employers. The strong success of LinkedIn is a clear indicator of how important this is. In the five years since Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, revenue has nearly tripled and growth has accelerated.\\n\\nToday, LinkedIn has more than 774 million members and is a leader in B2B advertising, professional hiring, corporate learning, and sales intelligence. From LinkedIn profiles within Office, to LinkedIn Learning courses within Microsoft Viva, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads within Dynamics 365, we continue to bring the power of LinkedIn and Microsoft together to transform how people learn, sell, and connect.\\n\\nModern Work\\n\\nThe rise of hybrid work will be one of the most profound changes to the way people work in more than a century. To navigate it, organizations will need to embrace flexibility across their entire operating model, including the ways people work, the places they inhabit, and how they manage business process.\\n\\nOur approach to hybrid work starts with Teams\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the only all-in-one solution that supports meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation in day-to-day workflow. Over the past year, we introduced hundreds of new features, from new presenter modes to new inclusive meeting experiences, that make it easy for everyone to be full participants in meetings, whether they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re joining from home, the office, a conference room, or a factory floor. Nearly 250 million people use Teams every month.\\n\\nIn this new hybrid work environment, having a digital employee experience platform will be key to business success. This is why\\u00c2\\u00a0we introduced Microsoft Viva, which brings the information, resources, and support employees need to stay connected to each other and their company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s mission directly into the flow of work.\\n\\nThe past year has also made clear how essential PCs are to work, learning, and life at home. With\\u00c2\\u00a0Windows 11\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the biggest update to our operating system in a decade\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re reimagining everything from the platform to the store to help people and organizations be more productive, connected, and secure, and to build a more open ecosystem for developers and creators. With every new generation of Windows, we also unlock the next generation of hardware innovation across our ecosystem. And I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m excited to see new PCs from Surface and our OEM ecosystem ship with Windows 11 this holiday season that include the latest innovations in touch, pen, and voice, as well as new breakthroughs in both accessibility and sustainability.\\n\\nAnd with\\u00c2\\u00a0Windows 365, we are creating a new category: the cloud PC. By bringing the operating system to the cloud, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re enabling organizations to stream the full Windows experience to their employees\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 personal or corporate device with just a few clicks. This will give organizations greater flexibility and a more secure way to empower employees to be productive and connected, regardless of their location.\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nThe threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging, and security has never been more critical for our customers or society as a whole. In response,\\u00c2\\u00a0we will invest $20 billion over the next five years\\u00c2\\u00a0to advance our security solutions. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its security capabilities through a Zero Trust architecture built on our comprehensive solutions that span identity, security, compliance, and device management across all clouds and platforms.\\n\\nBeyond our products, our operational security posture and threat intelligence help customers defend themselves. Last year, we intercepted 30 billion email threats and 31 billion authentication attacks. And as I write this, we are tracking more than 140 groups that pose an active threat to global cybersecurity.\\n\\nGaming\\n\\nThree billion people around the world play games, which makes gaming the largest category in the entertainment industry. We are expanding our opportunity to reach every one of them.\\n\\nWith Xbox Game Pass, we are transforming how people discover, connect, and engage with games. Great content drives Game Pass\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 growth, and\\u00c2\\u00a0our acquisition this year of ZeniMax Media\\u00c2\\u00a0adds some of the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s most iconic franchises to the service. We also continue to lead in the fast-growing cloud gaming market. Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available on PCs, as well as phones and tablets, and later this year will come to the console.\\n\\nIntroduced in November 2020, the new Xbox Series S and X are our fastest-selling consoles ever. And we continue to expand our opportunity in the creator economy by adding new ways for players to build and monetize their creations in many of our most popular games.\\n\\nOUR PURPOSE\\n\\nAs we pursue the opportunities ahead, we also recognize our increased responsibility in a world that will require much more from technology to address its most pressing challenges. To help people and organizations everywhere achieve more, we are focused on four interconnected pillars.\\n\\nSupport inclusive economic opportunity\\n\\nAt Microsoft, we believe that the economic growth we help drive must reach every person, community, and country. This starts with access to broadband. The pandemic has underscored that without it, people lack access to education, healthcare, economic opportunity, and more. We are continuing our efforts to extend broadband access to millions of people in rural and underserved communities in the United States and around the globe. In the United States, we expanded our work this year to include\\u00c2\\u00a0eight cities\\u00c2\\u00a0with particularly large broadband gaps, especially among Black and African American communities.\\n\\nWe must also continue to increase access to digital skills. In June 2020, with tens of millions of people displaced from their jobs due to the pandemic, we brought resources together from across Microsoft, inclusive of LinkedIn and GitHub, to help\\u00c2\\u00a025 million people connect to the digital skills for in-demand roles. Together with our partners, we have reached more than 47 million people to date, across 250 countries, but the work doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t stop there. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re helping companies make 250,000 skills-based hires this year\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094ensuring those who learn digital skills can convert them into jobs and opportunity. For example, through LinkedIn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s new\\u00c2\\u00a0Skills Path\\u00c2\\u00a0pilot, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re providing tools to help businesses source job candidates in a more equitable way\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094based on their proven proficiencies.\\n\\nTo build a more inclusive economy, we also have a responsibility to help close the Disability Divide, which impacts more than 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. That\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s why in April we announced a new\\u00c2\\u00a0five-year commitment\\u00c2\\u00a0to spur the development of accessible technology, expand opportunities for people with disabilities in the workforce, and build a more inclusive workplace.\\n\\nAnd we continue to make our technology affordable and accessible to nonprofit organizations around the world. This year, we provided $2.5 billion in donated and discounted products and services to help 295,000 nonprofits better serve their communities. Our employees donated an additional $214 million (including the company match) to the organizations and causes they care about.\\n\\nProtect fundamental rights\\n\\nWe support the fundamental rights of all people. This year, we made progress in our work to\\u00c2\\u00a0address racial injustice and inequity. We released our first annual\\u00c2\\u00a0Racial Equity Initiative: Strengthening Our Communities report, which focuses on justice reform, affordable broadband, skills and education, and support for community-based nonprofits. And we continue to improve the representation of our ecosystem by engaging with diverse suppliers, financial institutions, and channel partners. While we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re proud of our progress, we know we have much more work to do to help our communities, increase representation, and strengthen our\\u00c2\\u00a0culture of inclusion\\u00c2\\u00a0to influence broader, systemic change.\\n\\nWe must also protect the institutions and processes of democracy. Through our\\u00c2\\u00a0Democracy Forward Program, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re working across sectors to safeguard electoral processes and defend against disinformation. And to\\u00c2\\u00a0preserve and protect journalism, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re helping strengthen local news ecosystems, restore trust in news, and provide cybersecurity and legal security for journalists.\\n\\nFinally, we continue to\\u00c2\\u00a0stand up for human rights, which includes taking action to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain and supporting\\u00c2\\u00a0humanitarian action and emergency response. Last year, we mobilized resources to respond to the Beirut explosion, hurricanes in Central America, wildfires in the United States, and more. To date, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve committed cash, technology, and other resources with a value of more than $410 million to support ongoing COVID-19 response efforts.\\n\\nCommit to a sustainable future\\n\\nWhile the pandemic has been the defining issue of the past year-and-a-half, climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. And as a global technology company, we have a particular responsibility to do our part. In January, we released our first annual\\u00c2\\u00a0sustainability report, sharing our progress toward becoming carbon negative, zero waste, and water positive by 2030. In fiscal year 2020, Microsoft reduced its carbon emissions by 587,000 metric tons and purchased the removal of 1.3 million metric tons of carbon. We are building a Planetary Computer to help manage and protect Earth\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s natural systems. And we have made a\\u00c2\\u00a0commitment\\u00c2\\u00a0to match 100 percent of our electricity consumption with zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time by 2030.\\n\\nWe also know that solving the carbon problem will require new technology and partnerships. This is why we launched the\\u00c2\\u00a0Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094to create a new business process category that will help every organization measure, report, and reduce their environmental impact. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also why we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re making direct investments through our $1 billion\\u00c2\\u00a0Climate Innovation Fund\\u00c2\\u00a0to help organizations accelerate the development of solutions for carbon reduction and removal technology.\\n\\nEarn trust\\n\\nWe want our customers and partners to build their own digital capability and become independent\\u00c2\\u00a0with\\u00c2\\u00a0us, not dependent\\u00c2\\u00a0on\\u00c2\\u00a0us. This is not possible without trust. For Microsoft, trust is built on privacy, security, digital safety, the responsible use of AI, and transparency.\\n\\nOur approach to privacy begins with the belief that people have a right to own their personal data and that companies have a responsibility to collect and use personal data responsibly. This is why we were the first major tech company to support GDPR\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the EU\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s privacy law that is the standard for privacy legislation around the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and why we are strong advocates for passage of comprehensive federal privacy legislation in the United States.\\n\\nIt extends to our investments in security, and our belief that the public and private sectors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including tech companies\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094must be transparent so we can work together on a coordinated global response.\\n\\nHow we develop and use AI is also a critical component of trust. To ensure our AI technologies are used responsibly and to avoid unintended consequences, we take a principled approach built on fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Our\\u00c2\\u00a0Office of Responsible AI\\u00c2\\u00a0ensures that we put these principles into practice, and our\\u00c2\\u00a0Responsible AI Resources Center\\u00c2\\u00a0shares guidelines and tools to help our customers and the developer community do the same.\\n\\nFinally, we believe transparency is the foundation of trust, so we continue to offer clear information on how we run our business and work with customers and partners. Our\\u00c2\\u00a0CSR Reports Hub\\u00c2\\u00a0provides detailed information on law enforcement access to data, our environmental data, our political activities, our workforce demographics, and our human rights work.\\n\\nNo one company, industry, or country can solve these challenges alone. While our own actions are important, our most critical contribution will come from sharing our learnings and helping other organizations achieve their own goals for a better future too.\\n\\nOUR CULTURE\\n\\nUltimately, our culture will determine the lengths of what we will achieve. We aspire to create a culture where employees are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, and to share things they learn. This is why we put so much emphasis over the past few years on building a culture that centers on our\\u00c2\\u00a0commitment to a growth mindset.\\n\\nThis growth mindset served us well during the past year of crisis, disruption, and transformation. It drives our passion to obsess about our customers, and to learn about and from them. It has helped us become more empathetic toward our colleagues and enabled us to work together as a team\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as One Microsoft. And it underlies our approach to diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nWe know that as we become more representative of the communities where we live and work, and the people around the world who we aspire to serve, we become better at helping everyone on the planet achieve more. Diversity and inclusion continues to be a core priority for every employee at Microsoft and is incorporated into our performance and career development approach. To accelerate the inclusion journey for employees, as well as our ecosystem, we hosted\\u00c2\\u00a0Include 2021, a global event focused on diversity and inclusion, and continue to invest in shared understanding by publishing\\u00c2\\u00a0resources and learnings\\u00c2\\u00a0broadly. And in the\\u00c2\\u00a0first year of our commitment\\u00c2\\u00a0to address inequity and racial injustice, we are well on our way to doubling the number of Black and African American, Hispanic, and Latinx employees in leadership positions at Microsoft in the United States by 2025.\\n\\nCare is the new currency for every leader, and we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve built a new framework to help our managers strengthen their teams and deliver success through empowerment and accountability. Our managers strive to model our culture and values in their actions, to coach their teams to define objectives and adapt and learn, and to care deeply for their employees, seeking to understand their capabilities, ambitions, and invest in their growth.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAlthough it may be difficult to imagine in this time of immeasurable hardship and deep uncertainty, I see boundless possibility ahead. I am encouraged because of the power of you, our shareholders, our employees, our partners, our customers, and everyone who has continued to work hard to make the world a better place in the face of constraints. And if we continue to pursue our mission, I am certain that we will collectively achieve so much more together.\\n\\nI couldn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t be more optimistic.\\n\\n\\n\\nSatya Nadella\\n\\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Microsoft_Nadella_2021.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 239,\n        \"max\": 239,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          239\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Our transformation journey is well underway with clear results that illustrate our commitment to delivering excellence.\\n\\nWe are proud to have launched our new brand, which gives clear meaning to the letters \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cDXC\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cDelivering eXcellence for our Customers and Colleagues.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nOur brand is innovative. Our new logo has two arrows pointing to the X, reminding us to deliver excellence in everything we do for our customers and colleagues. We also introduced our new core values: Deliver, Collaborate, Community, Care, and Do the right thing. This is truly a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnew DXC.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nWe have been running a structured playbook, which is our\\u00c2\\u00a0proven methodology for how we transform a company to\\u00c2\\u00a0deliver sustainable growth. The stabilization phase was\\u00c2\\u00a0completed in FY21.\\n\\nIn FY21, starting with our colleagues, we moved from a workforce that was not engaged to one that is now engaged and inspired. Concerning our customers, we went from challenged accounts to building a level of customer intimacy where we are delivering, building strong partnerships and being proactive. We have simplified our operating model and changed the direction of our revenues and margins from declining to improving. We are winning in the market, and we significantly decreased our debt, taking our balance sheet from highly leveraged to strengthened. These efforts are leading to stable revenue growth, improved margins and continued success in the market. We are on the right trajectory.\\n\\nAs the world witnesses the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus continues to be on our people. I am proud of the dedication and perseverance of our team as they continue to take care of themselves, each other and their families, and deliver for our customers.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, we enabled 99% of our\\u00c2\\u00a0people worldwide to work virtually and opened a COVID-19\\u00c2\\u00a0Command Center that still runs 24/7. Employees have access\\u00c2\\u00a0to virtual mental health services and other resources. We\\u00c2\\u00a0have conducted mental health awareness and resiliency\\u00c2\\u00a0sessions and augmented our Employee Assistance Program\\u00c2\\u00a0globally. Where possible, in severely impacted geographies,\\u00c2\\u00a0we have increased health insurance benefits and deployed\\u00c2\\u00a0other specific support.

The pandemic brought extraordinary challenges, heartbreaking stories, significant loss and moments of inspiration as our associates overcame challenge after challenge. We witnessed their courage, kindness and generosity. Across the world in our stores, clubs and supply chain, they have come together to serve our customers, each other, and their communities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I wrote this letter last year, uncertainty over the length and severity of the health crisis was at its peak. I described five priorities for our company that would be our guide, and I outlined specific initiatives we had implemented to address urgent needs. The priorities were:\\n\\nSupport for associates\\n\\nService to customers\\n\\nHelp for others\\n\\nManage the business, and\\n\\nAdvance the strategy\\n\\n\\n\\nThese priorities remain unchanged today and to support them we paid $1.6 billion in special cash bonuses to our associates last year, implemented special COVID benefits, hired hundreds of thousands of displaced workers, set up COVID testing sites, provided relief to small businesses, donated more than 625 million pounds of food, pledged over $55 million in grants for hunger relief, and now we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re helping with vaccination efforts across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. As customers increasingly sought contactless shopping experiences, we expanded or launched pickup and delivery capabilities in most of our markets, and we dedicated more resources to support our rapidly growing eCommerce business. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re also making longer term investments in our people, technology and supply chain to support strong growth. Last fall, we announced wage increases for 165,000 associates. And, in February, we announced wage increases for an additional 425,000 associates. We are able to do so much for our stakeholders because our business is strong, and we have momentum. Last fiscal year, we had record revenues of $560 billion. That\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s an increase of more than $35 billion in one year. We also saw record operating cash flow of $36 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are constantly learning from new experiences and events and 2020 gave us plenty of opportunities to reflect, adjust, and plan for the future. It also confirmed our omni strategy is the right one. We have made tremendous progress on key elements of our customer value proposition. Our associates have done an amazing job serving customers and members and keeping them safe in our stores and clubs this past year. Our pickup and delivery businesses are scaling along with a global eCommerce business that should reach more than $100 billion in sales over the next couple of years. The pandemic also accelerated the shift from traditional retailing to a more digital experience where companies meet the customer on their terms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have a powerful set of assets that provide a strong foundation as we write the next chapter of the Walmart story. We have made gains in recent years that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll protect, including the value for customers we offer and the lead we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve built in pickup services. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re broadening the scope of products and services we offer to increase relevance in more customers lives, while layering in a more robust digital experience to improve engagement. And now we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll accelerate investments in key areas to support faster sales growth and keep the current asset base fresh.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we enter the next stage of our growth story, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re doing it from a position of strength. Now is the time for us to be aggressive and invest to accelerate growth. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re moving quickly. The decisions we make reflect confidence in our strategy. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve outlined a few key areas where we need to invest to move even faster to seize the opportunities for growth that lay before us.\\n\\nFirst, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll add eCommerce fulfillment capacity and automation through new facilities and within or adjacent to stores to increase pickup and delivery capacity and improve productivity. The market has experienced outsized growth in online shopping since the beginning of the pandemic, and we believe this trend will continue. That means we need to stay ahead and build solutions that help us continue to earn primary destination with customers.\\n\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll also continue to invest in the value proposition for Walmart+ to ensure high NPS and customer retention. The investments in fulfillment I just mentioned will play a key role here too as we invest in capacity to meet demand. With time, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll add new benefits to the membership, which will make it appealing to more customers and drive sustainable member and revenue growth.\\n\\nExpanding our online assortment of general merchandise is also key to what we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll accomplish. We must ensure we have the brands customers are looking for and we will accomplish this through our 1P owned inventory assortment or through our 3P marketplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaking targeted investments to help achieve our aggressive growth plans is important. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also important for us manage our portfolio so we are deploying capital where we see the best opportunity for growth while pulling back in other areas. Over the past few years, we have divested restaurants, specialty apparel, banks, eCommerce businesses in the U.S., and we exited or reduced our exposure in Brazil, Argentina, the U.K. and Japan. We made these moves while also investing in important partnerships like JD.com, Dada, Rakuten, Aditya Birla Fashion Retailer, Ninjacart and a fintech startup in the U.S. We have a lot of workstreams underway, and I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m confident that we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re spending our time and resources where they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll provide the best returns over time.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo pull these workstreams together into a cohesive, well-executed strategy the organization is thinking and working in new ways. Whether it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s working in an agile way, prioritizing digital acumen and diversity in our talent base, or developing new ownership structures around the world \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 we are evolving as a company and functioning in a way that supports innovation, speed and productivity. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re doing all of this while keeping true to the core values we share at Walmart.\\n\\nOur values are simple and guide our business decisions, but the outcomes also have a powerful impact on the world given Walmart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s scale. We believe trust is a competitive advantage. We run our business using a shared value approach. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s an ideology that guides us in all aspects of the business. The best way to create a valuable company is to build for the long term, manage the short term, and serve all relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September of 2020, Walmart announced its aspiration to become a regenerative company. This is a holistic approach through which we have set aggressive targets, including:\\n\\nZero emissions in our own operations by 2040, with no offsets\\n\\n100% renewable energy to power our facilities by 2035\\n\\nElectrify our vehicles by 2040, and\\n\\nManage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030\\n\\nThese are not one-off projects we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re working on. They are strategic and core to what we do. I encourage you to read more about our efforts on regeneration as well as our leadership on other priorities in the upcoming Environmental, Social and Governance report to be published in June.\\n\\nOur company has also taken a leadership role to help tackle other challenges that face our society. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m really proud of the work we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re doing on racial equity. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s something we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re committed to. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re finding ways to leverage our size and influence to shape financial, healthcare, education and criminal justice systems and create more equity, more often. Ensuring equality for all citizens is the right thing to do, and it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s smart business. A more diverse and inclusive workforce is a more powerful workforce.\\n\\nIn closing, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll once again thank our associates. They serve customers and their communities in a way that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s simply incredible. That\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s why so many customers trust Walmart. They trust who we are as a company, our values and what motivates us. They also trust us to keep them at the center of all that we do. Our business model has evolved and will look different in the future than in the past. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re innovating on behalf of our customers and increasingly touching more parts of their lives and providing solutions. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re driven to create a seamless, value-added and more digital experience, and we have the assets to deliver that for them. We have momentum in our business, which is a direct result of investments we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve made in recent years. Today, we see a unique opportunity to step up investments in key areas to make our business even stronger and grow faster. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re confident our strategy will allow Walmart and its stakeholders to win for many years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nDoug McMillon\\n\\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWalmart Inc.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Walmart_McMillon_2021.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 366,\n        \"max\": 366,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          366\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In my more than 20 years with The Home Depot, I have never been more thankful for the culture that our founders instilled in the business over 40 years ago. Our values provide the lens through which we evaluate our decisions, and anchoring to them in this time of crisis was critical to our success. Our focus has been and continues to be on two key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers, and providing our customers and communities with the products and services they need. The team\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s alignment around these two objectives enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions and implementing a number of changes across the business. At the onset of the pandemic, to promote safety for associates and customers, we implemented changes in our stores, including reducing store hours, proactively limiting the number of customers in a store, and eliminating certain traffic driving events. We also instituted a number of operational changes like floor markings, plexiglass shields, and a requirement that all associates and customers wear masks or facial coverings while in our U.S. stores and other facilities. In addition to safety, we focused on making operational changes to better support the customer experience. Those changes were supported by investments in technology and infrastructure that helped us to extend our buy online, pick-up in-store offering to curbside in a matter of days and convert a newly opened Market Delivery Center to a Direct Fulfillment Center in order to reduce online delivery lead times and improve the customer experience. The further mechanization of our upstream supply chain helped us to better flow product to our stores, while investments in tools for our store associates and merchandising execution teams helped to get that product to shelves for the customer more quickly and efficiently. We invested a total of approximately $2 billion on enhanced compensation and benefits in fiscal 2020, including expanded paid time off for all hourly associates to use at their discretion, the implementation of a temporary weekly bonus program and double pay for overtime worked during a portion of the year. Associates also received record Success Sharing payments, our profit sharing program for hourly associates, in fiscal 2020. In addition, we offered benefits such as free unlimited emotional and mental health counseling, free medical advice, and extended dependent care benefits. And, as we announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we have transitioned from temporary COVID-19 benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline, hourly associates. \\n\\nInvesting in The One Home Depot \\n\\nWe never thought it would have been possible for the business to grow by over $21 billion in fiscal 2020. For context, it took us 19 years as a company to achieve the first $20 billion in total sales, and we outgrew that in one year alone. This was enabled by investments we have made in the business, which provided us the agility and flexibility to execute in the dynamic operating environment, as well as the team\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s solid execution and cross-functional alignment. It is our opinion that retailers that create a seamless, interconnected experience, blending the physical and digital worlds, will be positioned well in the marketplace. Our digital properties experienced record traffic throughout the year, demonstrating the strength of our interconnected retail strategy. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 86 percent versus the prior year, and approximately 60 percent of online orders were fulfilled through the store. The acceleration of growth in our interconnected and digital offerings gave us the opportunity to showcase, in a very condensed timeframe, new capabilities and different ways for customers to engage with The Home Depot. Our strategic initiatives continued to progress during the year despite an extremely difficult operating environment. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as the opening of various supply chain facilities, technology investments, and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track. At the onset of the pandemic, in an effort to prioritize safety, we decided to pause certain in-store investments, such as merchandising resets. These initiatives restarted during the second half of the year, and we anticipate that all accelerated investments related to our stores will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. As we closed fiscal 2020, we had nearly completed our multi-year, accelerated investment program. We have more conviction than ever that we have been investing in the right areas of the business and will continue to invest to extend our competitive advantages and enable market share growth in any environment. We believe that our scale, combined with a low-cost position and continuous focus on the customer, will help us win in a highly competitive marketplace and deliver exceptional returns for shareholders.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe have more conviction than ever that we have been investing in the right areas of the business and will continue to invest to extend our competitive advantages and enable market share growth in any environment.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nFiscal 2020 Financial Highlights \\n\\nOur results for the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. During fiscal 2020, total sales grew $21.9 billion to $132.1 billion, an increase of approximately 20 percent compared to fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 comparable sales growth was 19.7 percent for the total company and 20.6 percent in the U.S. Our fiscal 2020 net earnings were $12.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased 16.5 percent to $11.94.\\n\\nOne thing that did not change in fiscal 2020 is our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our first principle is to reinvest in the business to drive growth faster than the market. In addition to our other investments, at the end of fiscal 2020 we completed the acquisition of HD Supply Holdings, Inc., a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets. We believe the acquisition of HD Supply strategically positions us to drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented, $55 billion marketplace. Our second capital allocation principle is to grow our dividend with earnings. During Fiscal 2020 we remained committed to paying our quarterly dividend, and for the year, we returned approximately $6.5 billion to our shareholders in dividends. And finally, while we remain committed to our third principle of returning excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, the ongoing uncertainty presented by the pandemic led us to temporarily suspend share repurchases to strengthen our liquidity position. Our strong liquidity position at the end of fiscal 2020 reflects our outstanding cash flow generation, and we resumed our share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In closing, I want to thank our supplier partners for their support and partnership throughout this year. I am also incredibly proud of our team\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s effort, and I want to thank our associates for the way they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these unquestionably challenging times.\\n\\n\\n\\nCraig Menear\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Home Depot_Menear_2021.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 182,\n        \"max\": 182,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          182\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It has been a long, painful year, and a great deal has transpired. No one could have known for certain that, over a year later, we would still face a pandemic with tens of thousands of new cases daily, and a U.S. death toll well in excess of 500,000 lives. For Southwest Airlines, we were not immune. We mourn those Southwest Family Members who died from the virus and are grateful they were few in number. Our remarkable string of 47 consecutive years of profits\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a record unprecedented in the commercial airline industry and dating back to our first full year of operation in 1972\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094was broken in 2020 with a net loss of $3.1 billion. In plain terms, the pandemic led to a breathtaking plunge in travel, tourism, and hospitality sector revenues, leading to massive losses. In Southwest\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s case, following solid year-over-year net income growth in January and February 2020, our operating revenues fell a staggering 92 percent in April 2020 compared with 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Since then, revenues recovered to roughly 35 percent of previous levels by September 2020, where they remained until early March 2021. Now that vaccines are available, vaccinations are on the rise in the United States; COVID-19 hospitalizations are down; and travel demand is finally trending positive. Operating revenues must, at least, double from current levels to achieve cash burn break even; but it appears the worst is behind us. After an extraordinarily difficult year, that is very welcome news for all. Despite the ravages of the pandemic, a great deal was accomplished in 2020 and over the past year. And, we are hopeful and optimistic we will emerge from this crisis strong and with abundant opportunities and competitive advantages. Those views are apparently shared by many, as our stock price, as of the date of this letter, has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, notwithstanding our current revenue and earnings deficits. Our top priority is always the safety and well-being of our People and our Customers. The financial health of our Company, which is vital in serving our People and Customers, is a close second. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m pleased to report both priorities were addressed and in dramatic fashion. First, a number of health and safety protocols were swiftly enacted, many of which remain in place today. Working with physician-scientists with knowledge and expertise in infectious disease, we implemented multiple layers of protections, including enhanced aircraft and airport cleaning protocols; the installation of Plexiglas\\u00c2\\u00ae shields at ticketing and gate counters; measures to support physical-distancing in airports; the requirement to wear masks or face coverings for Customers and Employees; and procedures to apply both an electrostatic disinfectant and an anti-microbial spray on every surface of the aircraft. Our airplanes were already equipped with sophisticated air circulation systems, which utilize HEPA filters that capture 99.97 percent of airborne particles1\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094similar to the technology found in hospitals. Second, given the dramatic decline in passengers and revenues, we took a number of steps to protect the financial health of the Company and boost cash reserves. We aggressively reduced our flying capacity, with available seat miles (ASMs, or capacity) declining 34.2 percent for all of 2020. We suspended dividends and share repurchases and cut capital spending. We offered our Employees voluntary separation and extended leave programs. And, we cut operating costs wherever possible. All told, we were able to cut $8 billion of planned spending in 2020. In the five years ended 2019, we raised capital of $1.6 billion, total. For the year 2020, we raised $18.9 billion, including $5.2 billion of re-financings. Importantly, we secured $3.4 billion in federal stimulus and loans through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). While this cash is vital to funding the inevitable operating losses incurred due to and during this pandemic, our immediate objective is to minimize cash burn so we emerge from this pandemic in a solid financial position to begin the recovery and repair process. For the year 2020, we incurred a net loss of $3.1 billion, or $5.44 loss per diluted share. These results included after-tax impacts: $1.5 billion in federal payroll support; $980 million in charges from voluntary Employee programs; and various other special items, including a gain from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions. Excluding these special items2, we incurred a net loss of $3.5 billion, or $6.22 loss per diluted share. We ended 2020 with a record level of liquidity, or $14.3 billion, including $11.1 billion in cash, $2.3 billion in short-term investments, and a fully-available, unsecured, revolving credit line of $1.0 billion. Importantly, this exceeded our $10.3 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2020. As a true testament to our strength and our preparedness, we have maintained our investment grade credit ratings: Moody\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, Baa1; Standard & Poor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, BBB; and Fitch, BBB+. We entered 2020 with the strongest balance sheet in Southwest history, with adjusted debt3-to-total invested capital of only 24 percent. Remarkably, we were able to absorb the 2020 blow and end the year with adjusted balance sheet leverage of 56 percent. Total operating revenues were $9.0 billion, a 59.7 percent decrease compared with 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s record $22.4 billion. The year-over-year plunge in passenger traffic accounts for this decline, with revenue passengers carried down 59.7 percent, also. ASMs were adjusted down 34.2 percent, year-over-year, given the collapse in demand. And, load factor fell 31.1 points from a healthy 83.5 percent in 2019, to 52.4 percent in 2020. With very weak demand, average fares and passenger revenue yields (per revenue passenger mile, or RPMs) fell 8.6 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively. Importantly, we did not eliminate any of the destinations we serve. Instead, we were able to add six destinations in 2020 and have, to-date, announced 13 more for 2021. We started 2020 serving 101 destinations, having just launched service to the Hawaiian Islands in 2019. We ended the year with 107 destinations, including 93 domestic, seven international, and seven temporarily suspended international markets due to COVID-19. I am very proud we were able to serve all our domestic communities. I am grateful we had available opportunities to add service and generate new Customers, trips, and revenues. Given a surplus of aircraft, Employees, and airport facilities, these proved to be positive cash flow alternatives to otherwise idle assets and personnel. Demand for commercial air travel generally falls into two broad categories: business and consumer (or leisure). Typically, roughly 35 percent of our Passengers travel for business, while the majority, or 65 percent, are traveling for personal reasons. The current airline business depression is unique, in that it is driven more by pandemic-related health concerns rather than by economic or recessionary reasons. In past recessions, while leisure travel demand was reasonably sustained, business travel demand dropped sharply and was indifferent to fare incentives to stimulate marginal travel. Historically, it has taken roughly five years, on average, for business travel to recover to pre-recession levels. In 2020, with passenger counts down 60 percent, business travel, predictably, dropped more\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094closer to 90 percent. It may take many years for business travel to recover to pre-pandemic levels, especially considering the swift, forced move to remote office work enabled by online collaboration tools and video/audio conferencing technologies. Regardless of the rate of a rebound in business travel, we are better prepared with last year\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s launch of global distribution system (GDS) access through Amadeus and Travelport, and the planned launch with Sabre later this year. Our GDS channel strategy complements existing Southwest Business options with the goal of expanding service to corporate travelers through their preferred booking channel, which we didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t have access to prior to this initiative. We believe we are well-positioned for success. First, we have a low-fare brand that is beloved by consumers. We do not charge hidden fees, including no charge for the first and second checked bags and no change fees4. We have a very generous frequent flyer program that handsomely rewards travel on Southwest, as well as spending using the Southwestbranded Chase\\u00c2\\u00ae Visa credit card. Awards are redeemable for every open seat on every Southwest flight. Our efficient, reliable, low-cost business model supports this low-fare brand. Our business model is famous for such attributes as point-to-point scheduling; a focus on nonstop itineraries; a single aircraft type that simplifies staffing, training, scheduling, operations, and maintenance and repairs; single class service; open seating; and direct distribution. Second, we have a strong presence across top markets, serving America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s largest cities, including an expanding array of attractive leisure destinations including Florida, Colorado, California, and Hawaii, to name only a few. In the last decade, we have added 14 attractive, near-international destinations in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. Since the pandemic began, our fleet of more than 700 aircraft became vastly underutilized. We began searching for new pools of Customers by introducing service to new leisure destinations and seized opportunities to announce or open 17 new airports since March 1, 2020. All told, these exciting new destinations will put roughly 40 idle aircraft and over 500 Employees to work. We are well-prepared for a larger, more permanent mix of leisure travel, along with a predominantly domestic route network. Third, our People run a great operation and offer outstanding hospitality. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll summarize by saying our superb ontime performance5 was 86 percent in 2020, with Company-record baggage handling accuracy, and an industry-best Customer Satisfaction Ranking6 with the U.S. Department of Transportation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094for the 27th time in the last 30 years. Our Customers remain huge fans, giving us a 2020 Net Promoter Score of 77. I am very grateful for our Customers and their loyal support. I am enormously indebted to our People who make this happen every day, thousands of times. They are magnificent. Put these three themes together\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094it is a powerhouse combination made for the moment: low fares, best schedule, and best service. I believe we are perfectly situated with a superior business model and for a leisure-led, low-fare environment. Add to that, we have the U.S. airline industry\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s strongest balance sheet, and our competitive lead, in this regard, has widened over the last year. All of this will be important, as we expect the next several years will be brutally competitive as the industry presses forward beyond survival on a long road of recovery and repair. Additionally, we have a longstanding history of being a responsible global citizen and doing the right thing for our People, Performance, and Planet. Our commitments did not waiver during the events of 2020. I am proud of how our Employees rose to the challenge in support of our Customers, communities, and each other. We are excited to strengthen our work in two key focus areas including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and environmental sustainability. Regarding our DEI work, this past year has shone a spotlight on many important issues surrounding racial injustice, discrimination, and a need in our world for what Southwest has always been known for\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094love. We have long been committed to diversity and inclusion and our journey began well before last summer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s increased national focus on racial injustice. While our diversity imperatives across the years laid a good foundation, 2020 helped us recognize we must commit to closely focusing in areas like diversity in our Senior Leadership and supplier diversity. We continue to look for opportunities to better reflect in our organization the diverse demographics of the communities we serve. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Department is partnering with departments across the Company to make these commitments a reality, in addition to their ongoing work to foster an inclusive work environment for our People. Our citizenship efforts also took an intentional focus on how we engage and interact with the Planet. For years, we have evaluated and executed ways we can improve environmental stewardship across our airline because we recognize we have a responsibility to the environment. Early last year, we launched a concentrated effort to find new ways to reduce our environmental footprint. This includes our intention to introduce sustainable aviation fuel into our supply chain, engage in carbon offsetting efforts where it makes sense, and improve our recycling efforts inflight and on the ground. We are working to establish strategic plans aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. While we are proud of our past citizenship accomplishments, we are ready to do more and know exciting things are ahead as these plans move forward. We have many other accomplishments and priorities. We were able to preserve our unprecedented 50-year history of providing job security to Employees. After almost two years out of revenue service, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is, again, flying for Southwest. We expect to take delivery of 28 MAX 8 aircraft this year, and plan to end 2021 with 69 MAX 8 aircraft and 729 total aircraft. We reached agreement with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to extend our order book through 2031, and selected the MAX 7 aircraft as the successor to the 737-700 model\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094reaching agreement on 100 firm orders for MAX 7 aircraft. This agreement with Boeing underscores our commitment to the continued modernization of the fleet with more fuel-efficient and climate-friendly aircraft, and it also positions Southwest to capitalize on growth opportunities, when they arise. We are expanding the number of airports served and pursuing new revenue streams. We are running a stellar operation. We remain steadfast in managing costs and cash spending, and we are focused on maintaining significant liquidity\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 a minimum of $10 billion at least until profits have stabilized. Our primary financial goals for 2021 are to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings; arrest cash operating losses; and achieve and sustain break even, or better, cash flow and earnings as travel demand recovers. We celebrate our 50th year of service in 2021, reflecting on our track record as the most successful airline in aviation history. We believe we are through the worst of the pandemic. We have renewed hope and optimism about the future of Southwest Airlines, and our People are ready. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nGary C.

Then the COVID-19 virus emerged and ultimately presented the most disruptive financial crisis in the history of commercial aviation. By April 2020, the world essentially shut down, and our revenues plummeted 99%. Since the beginning of the crisis, the hallmarks of United\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s response have been to maintain an objective and realistic assessment of the virus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s impact on our industry\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and to plan accordingly. Hope was never our strategy. Instead, the best collection of airline professionals in the business confronted the crisis headon and focused on three pillars that were critical to our ability to survive the crisis: 1) raise and maintain liquidity, 2) reduce cash burn and 3) variabilize our cost structure. Our primary goal throughout the crisis was to protect the safety of United\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s customers and employees. We also managed the crisis aggressively to ensure the airline\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and the jobs it supports\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094was here when customers began flying again. So, in pursuit of both objectives, we got to work on several industry-leading actions including: \\n\\nLeading on safety and cleaning, including becoming the first airline to mandate masks on board, our industry leading CleanPlus partnership with Cleveland Clinic and Clorox and many other initiatives; \\n\\nCutting costs and reducing cash burn, including becoming the first airline to announce the elimination of CEO and President base salaries, and later cutting officers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 salaries in half; \\n\\nUsing innovative approaches to raise over $26.0 billion in liquidity in 2020; \\n\\nPushing ahead with opportunistic commercial initiatives such as our cargo operations, new route announcements and being the first legacy airline to permanently eliminate change fees on domestic tickets; \\n\\nDespite the crisis, continuing to invest in industry-first digital capabilities like Search by Map, Travel Destination Guides, virtual agent and more; and \\n\\nEntering into an industry-leading deal with our pilots. \\n\\nThose efforts are part of the reason why United was able to turn the page away from just surviving to squarely focusing on preparing for the rebound. So, as we focus on our recovery, instead of trying to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009creturn to normal,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d we are focused on a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009creturn to new\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d mindset that means making meaningful changes that will put us in a position to emerge from the crisis as a new, stronger United Airlines. Our plan includes several areas of focus: \\n\\nTruly change how customers feel about United\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094During the crisis, we doubled-down on customer service, led the industry in cleaning and safety, and permanently got rid of change fees \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and our customer satisfaction scores went up by 30 points. We will continue this focus into 2021 and beyond and do things that make United the airline people want to fly. \\n\\nLead on environmental sustainability\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Our 100% Green by 2050 commitment is unique because we plan to accomplish this without relying on traditional carbon offsets, not only putting United in a leadership position among other airlines, but setting us apart from other big businesses around the world. Fighting climate change is a global challenge that requires big thinking and bold action, and United will not use greenwashing to achieve \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnet zero.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\n\\nAdvance Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094United is committed to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace and world. In 2020, we increased transparency and accountability by sharing diversity representation data with our employees, announcing that we have achieved and are committed to maintaining near perfect pay equity for employees of all genders and races performing comparable work across our U.S. operations. Moving forward, you will see even more substantive actions from us focused on our suppliers, the communities we serve and the way we attract and grow talent as we seek to become the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s most inclusive airline. \\n\\nMake innovation a hallmark of our future\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094We believe we have the best and fastest digital team of any airline in the world, and based on the technology changes we have already made to help our customers and employees navigate the crisis, there is no doubt in our minds that United has flown past the rest of the industry. We are committed to continuing to invest and innovate for our customers. \\n\\nRestore our balance sheet by maintaining liquidity, reducing debt and unencumbering assets\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Given the amount of debt we have taken on, it will take time to restore the balance sheet, and we will have to be thoughtful when it comes to paying down debt versus making investments. \\n\\nPermanently reduce our cost structure by $2.0 billion per year\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094To be clear, this is not about taking things away from our employees or customers. We have learned how to run a smarter, more efficient operation and developed some really good habits regarding cost discipline. We will carry those learnings into our post-crisis future. \\n\\nCOVID-19 changed our airline forever. And I am confident that the culture that served us well getting through the crisis is the same culture that will help us push through the recovery and accelerate on the other side as United gets back on track to becoming the global leader in aviation. \\n\\nThank you for your continued support of United.\\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nScott Kirby\\n\\nChief Executive Officer\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"United Airlines_Kirby_2021.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 349,\n        \"max\": 349,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          349\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
