# Topic Modeling for CEO Letters to Shareholders

## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for topic modeling of CEO letters to shareholders. Two different topic modeling techniques, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, are employed to extract and analyze topics from CEO letters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of CEO letters to shareholders from various companies and is located within the '/data' folder

## Setup
